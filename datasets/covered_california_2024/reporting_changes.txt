Reporting Changes to Covered California
Once you have enrolled, you are required to report information on your Covered California Application that changes.  Changes like income or household size may occur during the year that could affect the assistance that you qualify for.  It is very important that you report these types of changes in a timely manner so that you are enrolled in the right program and so that you donâ€™t have any unpleasant surprises at the end of the year and owe money to the IRS!

Covered CA requires you to report changes within 30 days

Special note for Pregnancy: You are NOT required to report a pregnancy to Covered CA.

Learn more about health coverage options for pregnant women.

Who do you report a change to?
It depends on how your household is enrolled.

If no one in your household is on Medi-cal, call 1-877-752-4737 to report changes.

Contact Medi-Cal to report your changes, if you or any member of your household is enrolled in Medi-Cal. Follow these steps:
First, call or visit your local county Medi-Cal office to report your change(s)
Then, if you or any member of your household is eligible for a Covered CA plan, call Covered CA to confirm and/or update your plan selection. Alternatively, if you used an insurance agency, you can call them for assistance in updating your plan.
Please Note: If you need to report a change during Renewal time or during the Open Enrollment Period, we advise that you call for assistance.
