Covered California Deadline
General Application Deadline to Enroll:

15th of the month for coverage to start the 1st of the following month

Note: Due to Covid-19 and the American Rescue Plan, you can enroll all the way up to the end of the month for coverage starting on the 1st of the next month (without a Qualifying Life Event).


There are two distinct times of the year to enroll with the Covered California Application and make plan changes: Open Enrollment and Special Enrollment. Within these two periods, different requirements and deadlines may apply.

Open Enrollment Period
This is when most anyone can sign up for individual and family health insurance. Check the dates for this year’s open enrollment period so you know which deadlines apply.

General Deadlines

December 15th for a January 1st effective date
January 15th for a February 1st effective date
Special Enrollment Period
To enroll during the special enrollment period you are required to have a qualifying life event occurring within the last 60 days. Deadlines will vary by life event. Here is a list of the most common life events with corresponding deadlines.

Effective Dates
Covered California deadlines are closely connected to the effective date of insurance. We suggested you work backward. Find out when you need your insurance to start, and then plan around the corresponding application deadline date.  If you don’t have a qualifying life event to apply mid-year, plan around the next open enrollment period.

Don’t Wait Last Minute!
The Covered California deadline days can be crazy. We notice more mistakes on applications submitted on these days than any other. Make a decision to plan ahead and set aside time to complete your application with no distractions. Submit your application a week if not more before the deadline. Less stress will produce a clearer mind and insure an easier process.

Note: In 2014 and 2015, the Covered California deadline was extended. In 2016, a one week extension was given for people who enrolled before the deadline. However, we do not anticipate there being any deadline extension for the Covered California 2017 Open Enrollment Period.
