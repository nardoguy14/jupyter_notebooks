2023 Silver 73: Enhanced Plan
The Silver 73 is one of  four Silver health plans available through Covered California. It is available to those who meet the Covered California eligibility requirements and whose income is a certain percentage of the Federal Poverty Level. Obtain a quote for Affordable Health Insurance for California to see if you are eligible for a Silver 73 plan.

The “73” refers to the average percentage that the plan will generally pay for health services. So under the Silver 73, enrollees may anticipate their health plan to pay about 73% of the total covered expenses. This plan features a deductible of $3,700 per individual or $7,400 for a family that is lower than the standard Silver 70 Plan. Also, it allows members to pay reduced fees of $35 to $85 for common services such as doctor visits, generic drugs, and other covered services.  And in the event of “worst case” the most you would pay for services in a year would be $6,500 per individual or $13,000 for a family.

Is the Silver 73 Right for Me?
This plan may be a good fit if:

You are relatively healthy.
If you want typical services such as office visits, basic labs, and prescriptions (generic) covered right away for a minimum set fee (copay) without having to pay a deductible.
You want more coverage than the Bronze 60 plan, but want a lower premium per month than the Gold Plan.

How does the Silver 73 compare to the Silver 70 Plan?
The main difference between the Standard Silver 70 and the Enhanced Silver 73 Plans is the deductible size and maximum out-of-pocket amounts that the consumer would pay.

A Little More to Think About
An individual may qualify for a Silver 73 Plan only if their income meets the qualifications and if they enroll through the Covered California Exchange. Typically, adults with an annual income of 200% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level may be eligible for a Covered California Silver 73 Plan. Minors 18 and under do not qualify and more than likely will have the option to enroll on Medi-Cal or some people opt to enroll them on a full priced plan.
