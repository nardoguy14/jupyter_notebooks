2023 Covered California Silver 70
The Covered California Silver 70 Plan offers a middle-of-the-road option for people who want affordable health insurance as well as some good benefits. Under this plan, popular services like office visits, generic drugs, x-rays and labs are covered at a flat fee (copay). A small drug deductible of $250 for an individual or $500 for family will apply for brand name, non-preferred brand name and specialty drugs.  A mid-size deductible of $2,500 per individual applies or $5,000 for a family but only on less commonly-needed services, like hospitalization.

Is the Silver 70 Right for Me?
This plan may be a good fit if:

You are relatively healthy.
If you want typical services such as office visits, basic labs, and prescriptions (generic) covered right away for a minimum set fee (copay) without having to pay a deductible.
You want more coverage than the Bronze 60 plan, but want a lower premium per month than the Gold Plan.

Bronze Plan vs Silver 70 Plan
The Bronze Plan has the lowest premium of all the metal plans with the exception of the Minimum Coverage Plan. The price is right. But with a $6,300 deductible for most services, it might not be the best plan if you often go in for doctor visits. In the long run, it may be more cost-effective to sign up for a Silver 70 Plan. This plan is still competitively-priced and the deductible does not apply to doctor visits, generic prescriptions, x-rays, and labs. So in the long run, you could save money on a Silver 70 Plan. To verify, do the math. Compare the premiums and the out-of-pocket costs for the Bronze and Silver 70 plans to determine which best-fits your budget and health care needs.

A Little More to Think About
The Silver 70 Plan has a mid-sized deductible of $2,500 per individual or $5,000 for a family. This applies to benefits such as hospitalization, and ambulance services. This means that if you go in for a service that is subject to the deductible, you pay the first $2,500/$5,000, then, the insurance kicks in. In addition to the deductible, you may also need to pay a fee called a copayment or coinsurance, depending on how much the bill was and what service was received. Altogether, you would never pay more than $6,800 per individual or $13,600 per family per year on a Silver 70 Plan.
