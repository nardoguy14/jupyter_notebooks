Note: Western Health Advantage has 1.5 Stars on Yelp with only 9 reviews. However, keep in mind that when it comes to health plans, often those who comment on Yelp are exclusively those who have had a bad experience and often it is those who have had a bad experience in one situation with a single physician. To keep this in perspective, Blue Shield of California has only 1 Star on Yelp, but Kaiser Permanente has 3 Stars.
