California IRS 1095 A Form that is covered

What is a 1095-A Form?
The 1095-A Form is a Covered California statement that is needed to file your Federal Income Tax Return. It shows how many months you had health insurance and how much Advanced Premium Tax Credit (APTC) you received. It is your proof that you had health insurance in place so that you won’t be subject to a tax penalty. It also helps to reconcile the amount of APTC that you received to the amount of income that you actually earned for the benefit year.
