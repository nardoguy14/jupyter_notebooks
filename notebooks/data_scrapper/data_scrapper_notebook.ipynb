Keeping a diverse group of people healthy with affordable health care options has been California’s ongoing challenge. This is why the Marketplace for private and small group medical insurance in California plays a significant role in maintaining happy, healthy individuals.The California Health ExchangeSimply put: This is where you get affordable coverage!Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), states across the country set up Marketplaces where you can purchase health insurance. These are referred to as State Exchanges. The exchange in the golden state is called Covered California.Through the Covered California website, qualified individuals and families can sign up for subsidized health insurance coverage. Discounts come in the form of up-front tax credits. Since 2013, this implementation of Obamacare in California has enabled over 2 million people to obtain inexpensive, quality healthcare. The California State Exchange includes some of the best insurance companies in the state.Insurance companies in the Marketplace include Anthem Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California, Kaisers Permanente and more. Benefit packages include Bronze 60, Silver 70 to 94, Gold 80 and Platinum 90 levels of coverage. These plans can be viewed in an apples-to-apples comparison.Purchasing health insurance through the State Exchange is like going to an online shopping mall.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year.

They must provide coverage for hospitalization, emergency, preventative care, and prescription drugs. These plans are ACA compliant. They offer high-quality, affordable coverage to everyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.  Short-Term Plans: Short-term health plans  are no longer legal in California (SB910). However, consumers may enroll in a traditional medical insurance plan for as little as 30 days. This can fill healthcare insurance gaps and protect consumers who are between jobs.  Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65. This medical coverage is also available to qualifying individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses or disabilities. Medicaid:  This is referred to as  Medi-Cal in California . This coverage is offered to individuals and families with a household income that is below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

Don’t get the most extensive plan if you feel it would not serve you. However, make sure you have enough coverage for unexpected situations, like an accident or if you develop a new condition.\\nPremiums and out-of-pocket costs:\\xa0When you retire, your budget will be more important than ever. When exploring your options, you should also make sure that your desired plans fit into what you can afford to spend.\\nAccess to your preferred providers:\\xa0Medicare plans do not cover all providers.\\xa0If you have a physician or hospital from which you want to receive treatment, ensure they’re a part of the network you’re exploring.\\nSpeaking with trusted advisors:\\xa0Whether it’s your best friend, a family member or a plan representative, you may want to discuss your options with someone that fully understands your Medicare options and can give you advice from experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility and Requirements\\nGenerally, you’re eligible for Medicare when:\\n\\nYou’re 65 years old or older.\\nYou are not 65 but have a qualifying disability or End-Stage Renal disease.\\nYou or your spouse have worked for ten years for an employer covered by Medicare.\\nYou’re a citizen or permanent United States resident.\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\nYou can begin the enrollment process for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday. You should make sure your enrollment is complete three months after your birthday at the latest. This time is your Initial Enrollment Period. You can enroll by\\xa0visiting the Social Security website\\xa0or\\xa0your local Social security office, or you can call them at 800-772-1213. When you enroll during this period, you can ensure you start getting your benefits as soon as you’re eligible for them and avoid paying penalty fees.\\nIf you miss applying during your Initial Enrollment Period, your next option is to sign up during the General Enrollment Period that happens every year between January 1 and March 31. You may also be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period\\xa0under certain circumstances.\\nIf you already receive Railroad Retirement or Social Security benefits and you’re turning 65, you might be automatically enrolled in the program. If so, you’ll get your Medicare card in the mail either three months before your 65th\\xa0birthday or once you’ve been on disability for 25 months.\\nStill Have Questions on Medicare Plans?\\nWe thought you would!

Be aware that free health insurance plans are available!\\n\\nObamacare Income Guidelines Chart Based on the Federal Poverty Level\\nAccording to Covered California income guidelines and salary restrictions, if an individual makes less than $47,520 per year or if a family of four earns wages less than $97,200 per year, then they qualify for government assistance based on their income. If the family has a lower household net income, then a greater amount of government assistance is available to the family. Tax deductions can lower your income level.

You qualify for pregnancy coverage even if you’re already pregnant when you apply for coverage. It’s important to have health coverage when you’re planning on having a baby for the following reasons:\\n\\nIt makes it easier to get prenatal care:\\xa0Pregnant women should see their doctors regularly throughout the pregnancy to track the progress and detect any issues. Detecting problems with the pregnancy early on helps ensure the health and safety of you and your baby.\\nIt makes the delivery affordable:\\xa0The U.S. is known for having one of the highest costs for delivery and maternity care globally. While you might have to pay something out-of-pocket, depending on your income and healthcare coverage, having insurance cuts the cost of delivery considerably.\\nIt gives you access to emergency care:\\xa0Everyone wants a healthy pregnancy, but complications can occur. Getting immediate access to emergency treatment and care can help save you and the baby.\\n\\n\\nSince having health coverage and getting access to healthcare is critical during pregnancy, the income requirements for pregnant people are slightly different than those for people who aren’t currently expecting a baby. Here’s what you might qualify for, depending on your income level:\\n\\nMedi-Cal:\\xa0If your earnings fall between 138% and 213% of the poverty level, you may qualify for modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) Medi-Cal during your pregnancy.\\nMedi-Cal Access Program (MCAP):\\xa0The Covered California income limits for MCAP are between 213% and 322% of the poverty level. MCAP charges a small fee and provides comprehensive coverage for pregnant individuals.\\n\\nWhen you apply for Medi-Cal while pregnant, your eligibility is presumed while your application is reviewed. That means you can take advantage of immediate coverage, ensuring you and your baby get the care you need.\\n\\nIncome Limits for Medi-Cal for Families With Children\\nAdults qualify for Medi-Cal with a household income of less than 138% of FPL. However, according to the Covered California income guide, children who enroll on Obama Care California plans may qualify for Medi-Cal when the family has a household income of 266% or less. The children must be under 19 years of age to qualify. Also, C-CHIP, the County Children’s Health Initiative Program, offers health care coverage for children when the family income is greater than 266% and up to 322% of FPL.\\n\\nHow to Provide\\xa0Proof of Income\\nDocument proofs (including pay stubs, bank statements, etc.) may be required to verify your household income threshold. If you fail to provide proof of income, you may lose your Obamacare subsidy or your health care coverage.\\nAcceptable proof can include:\\n\\nA pay stub\\nA bank statement\\nYour W-2\\nA tax return\\n\\nReporting Mid-Year Changes in Household Earnings\\nIf your\\xa0income\\xa0increases during the year, this may affect what levels of subsidies you qualify for according to Covered California income limits. It also may affect whether or not you, your spouse or your children qualify for certain government assistance programs.

You must live in the service area, and you must be enrolled in Part A and/or Part B to be eligible. Part D only covers out-patient prescription drugs.\\xa0\\nSign Up for a Webinar\\nSchedule a Consultation\\n\\nMedicare Advantage Part C usually includes prescription drug coverage. If you choose to go with a Supplement Plan or if your Part C does not include Rx, then you can add a stand-alone Part D prescription drug plan.\\n\\nAvoid the Part D Penalty\\nDuring your Initial Enrollment Period*, you must get on a prescription drug plan in order to avoid the penalty unless your current employer plan has creditable drug coverage**. The penalty for not having Part D is 1% of the national average premium ($33.37 in 2022) multiplied by the number of full months that you went without coverage for your medications.\\xa0\\nOnce you have been penalized, you will continue to pay that additional penalty fee as long as you have Part D coverage. At age 65, if you are not currently taking medications, we would recommend to at least purchase the least expensive Part D Plan to avoid the penalty.\\n* The “Initial Enrollment Period” is the 7-month period beginning 3 months before your 65th birthday month (for seniors) or 3 months before your 25th month of disability payments (for those with disabilities).\\n** “Creditable drug coverage” is prescription coverage that is at least as good as Medicare provides.\\n\\nHow to Enroll in a Medicare Drug Plan\\nFor Original Medicare, you enroll through the Social Security Administration, but for Part D you enroll through an agent or a private health insurance carrier in the state where you live. There are no health questions asked on the application, and you are eligible if you are enrolling through a valid enrollment period.\\xa0\\nYou can enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period or during the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP) each year, which is from October 15 – December 7. Click here to Shop and Compare Medicare Plans.\\nThe Deductible\\nMost Part D options have deductibles. However, the deductible often does not apply to Tier 1 medications. On some Part D plans, tier 2 drugs are also covered before the deductible.\\nAfter you reach your deductible, you will often have a copay for your prescriptions.\\xa0\\nMedications from Tiers 4 and 5\\nFor these more expensive drugs from Tiers 4 and 5, you will often pay a coinsurance percentage. For example, you might pay 30% of the cost of the drug. Then, the health insurance carrier would cover the remaining 70% of the cost.\\nTier 6 Drugs\\nMost Part D Plans are on a 5 Tier system. However, some health plans have a sixth tier where they offer certain medications at a reduced cost. Tier 6 prescriptions might include weight loss, hair loss meds, Viagra, or drugs for certain specific medical conditions.\\xa0\\nIf the Part D coverage is designed with certain health conditions in mind, medications related to those conditions might be included in Tier 6. For example, the plan might be focused on those with heart conditions, cancer, or diabetes. And, Tier 6 may include discounted drugs related to those medical conditions. Tier 6 is often not subject to the coverage gap (otherwise known as the “doughnut hole”).\\xa0\\nNo OOP Max on Part D\\nThis is arguably the biggest drawback to Medicare. Medications do not add toward an out-of-pocket maximum. Therefore, there is essentially no limit to how much a Part D member could pay for prescription drugs. For this reason, some seniors at 65 elect to stay on health insurance coverage through their employer. Be aware that staying on employer-sponsored coverage may or may not be an option for you and certain restrictions do apply.\\nCoverage Phases\\nDrug benefits through Part D or Medicare Advantage Plans have Coverage Phases. These are periods of time where the coverage changes.\\n\\nPhase 1: Advertised Coverage\\xa0\\n\\nThese advertised deductibles, copays, and percentages continue until you have used a cumulative total of $4,130 worth of medications (paid out by the consumer and the health plan).\\n\\nPhase 2: “Coverage Gap” or Doughnut Hole\\n\\nYou pay 25% of the cost of your meds. Some plans cover some drug tiers through the doughnut hole, but those are exceptions to the general rule. This continues until you have used a cumulative total of $6,550 worth of prescription medications (paid out by the consumer and health plan).\\n\\nPhase 3: “Catastrophic Coverage”\\n\\nFor generic drugs, you pay the greater of 5% or $3.70. For brand name medications, you pay the greater of 5% or $9.20. This continues through December 31 each year. On January 1, the whole process starts over, and you return to Phase 1.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

The Open Enrollment Period (OEP): November 1 through January 31Renewal Packets Arrive: October and NovemberThe Special Enrollment Period (SEP): February through OctoberMost enrollment occurs during the Open Enrollment Period. No Qualifying Life Events (QLE’s) are required at this time. For those renewing, OEP gives members the opportunity to change plans each year. You can cancel your plan at any time, but to change plans, that must be done during the Open Enrollment Period. Or, you can change plans during the Special Enrollment Period with a Qualifying Life Event.Normally, during the Special Enrollment Period you would need a QLE to enroll or change plans. Qualifying Life Events include losing coverage, losing a job, having a baby, moving to California, getting married or divorced, etc.).Due to President Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Covid-19 Pandemic, more opportunities for enrollment have opened up outside of OEP. Also, this legislation made greater discounts available.You can find the following types of plansIndividual and Family Healthcare Plans: Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, all non-grandfathered health plans must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. They must provide coverage for hospitalization, emergency, preventative care, and prescription drugs. These plans are ACA compliant. They offer high-quality, affordable coverage to everyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.  Short-Term Plans: Short-term health plans  are no longer legal in California (SB910). However, consumers may enroll in a traditional medical insurance plan for as little as 30 days. This can fill healthcare insurance gaps and protect consumers who are between jobs.  Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65. This medical coverage is also available to qualifying individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses or disabilities. Medicaid:  This is referred to as  Medi-Cal in California . This coverage is offered to individuals and families with a household income that is below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

Part A provides hospitalization coverage, and Part B is for office visits.\\nParts A and B\\nOriginal Medicare is the foundation of your Medicare coverage. Part A hospitalization coverage only includes the hospital room. Part B office visit coverage includes the bulk of Medicare benefits. Part B contains doctor visits, x-rays, emergency, ambulance, IV medications, labs, MRI’s, EKG’s, and even the doctors that treat you in the hospital.\\nSign Up for a Webinar\\nSchedule a Consultation\\n\\n\\nPremium-Free Part A\\nMany people qualify to get Part A for free. If you are not eligible for premium-free Part A and you fail to enroll in Part A at 65, then you may be subject to a 10% penalty when you do eventually enroll in Part A.\\xa0\\nIf you get retirement benefits through Social Security or the Railroad Retirement Board, then your Part A is free. For more details, click here. If you do not qualify for free Part A, then the price you pay is determined by how long you (or your spouse) worked and paid Medicare taxes. In most cases, if you buy Part A, you must also get Part B.\\nPart B: The Cost and the Penalty\\nYou can purchase Part B even if you choose not to get Part A. If you do not get Part B when you are Medicare eligible, you may have to pay a penalty, which is 10% extra for each 12-month period that you failed to sign up after you were eligible. Most people pay the standard premium amount for Part B ($164.90 in 2023). For higher income earners, they will pay an Income Related Adjustment Amount (IRMAA), which is based on your IRS tax return from 2 years earlier\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

The California Health Exchange was created to assist citizens and legal residents with applying for marketplace coverage in order to comply with the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”). When the law was passed in 2010, each of the 50 states had to decide to either create a state-run health insurance exchange or offer enrollment through a federally-operated exchange. This state chose to create their own exchange and called it “Covered California”.\\n\\nGet my free quote now!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat Does The California Health Exchange Do?\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Exchange helps Californians comply with the Obamacare mandate. It\\xa0helps individuals and families obtain\\xa0health coverage that includes the minimum essential benefits required by the law. Certain carriers are certified to offer subsidized\\xa0Obama Care Plans and Prices plans\\xa0and\\xa0dental plans\\xa0through the Exchange. These\\xa0Covered California plans\\xa0can sell insurance\\xa0on or off the Exchange. But for qualified consumers, rates can be better if the medical plan is purchased through the marketplace. For people with a household income that is below 400% of the\\xa0Federal Poverty Level\\xa0(“FPL”), Covered Ca may qualify them to receive financial assistance, also called a “Subsidy”, which reduces their premium. And if income is between 138% and 250% of the FPL, the State Exchange\\xa0may also qualify individuals for extra discounts that reduce their cost for medical services. These extra discounts are referred to as “Cost Sharing Reductions”. To be eligible for a subsidy and potentially for cost sharing reductions, you must fall within Covered California income limits and not be offered affordable, full coverage healthcare through an employer, Medicare, etc. Enrollments need to be submitted through the State Marketplace, a\\xa0Certified Insurance Agent, or a Certified Enrollment Counselor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Obama Care Mandate: What is required?\\nThe “mandate” refers to the federal law that requires all American citizens and legal residents to have qualified medical insurance. \\xa0This medical coverage may be acquired off-exchange or through Covered California. The mandate is also known as the Affordable Care Act, or Obama Care. For more information, visit Obama Care California. Under the mandate, Americans and legal residents are required to do one of the following:\\n * You can be uninsured for part of the calendar year and not be subject to a penalty so long as you are uninsured for less than three consecutive months. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBe enrolled on a qualified health plan. *\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFile an exemption from the mandate at tax time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPay a\\xa0Penalty for Being Uninsured\\xa0at tax time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is a qualified health plan?\\nFor Californians to be in compliance with the mandate, they’ll need to be enrolled on a qualified health plan, plan that meets the government’s requirements for minimum essential coverage. The main coverage requirement is that the insurance must cover the 10 minimum essential benefits, such as preventive services,\\xa0Prescription Drug Coverage, and maternity and newborn care. A medical plan can still be a qualified health plan without the minimum essential benefits if the plan is a\\xa0grandfathered plan, which is a medical plan that was in force before March 23, 2010 when the mandate was passed and which has not undergone major changes. Qualified health plans may be acquired through Covered California,\\xa0Medi-Cal, Medicare, group insurance, a plan through the military, or off-exchange directly through the carrier.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do I enroll in a Covered California Marketplace Health Plan?\\nUpdate:\\xa0Open-Enrollment begins November 1, 2023.\\xa0However, individuals and families with a\\xa0qualifying life event\\xa0may enroll now.\\nCalifornia State\\xa0health insurance applications are accepted once a year at open enrollment. The next open enrollment period is November 1, 2023 until January 31, 2024. During this time frame, you may apply for a new plan or switch Covered California plans. You do not have to have a special reason to apply. If you miss enrolling during this period, you will not be able to apply for Obamacare coverage until the next open enrollment. Exceptions apply.\\nYou may apply for Covered California health insurance outside of open enrollment if any of the following apply to you:\\n\\nYou have a qualifying life event, such as an involuntary loss of coverage, relocation, a change in marital status, or the birth of a child.\\xa0To apply for a special enrollment, you must submit an application within 60 days of the event date.\\nYou are part of a Federally-recognized American Indian tribe or are an Alaska Native. The open enrollment period does not apply to you. You may apply or switch Covered California plans once a month, if desired.\\nYou are eligible for Medi-Cal. You may apply year-round.\\n\\nBegin by getting\\xa0California health insurance quotes.\\xa0Select the plan of your choice and submit the online application. If you qualify for Medi-Cal, you can go to\\xa0www.coveredca.com\\xa0or contact your\\xa0local Medi-Cal office.\\nAfter you submit an application, you are not officially enrolled until you pay the first month’s premium. It must be remitted by the due date or your application will not be processed.\\nAs part of the application process, the State Insurance Exchange\\xa0will electronically verify your identity, citizenship or *immigration status, and your income. Records of other government agencies will be used. If Covered California is unable to verify your information, your application may be processed in one of the following ways:\\n\\nYour application may be marked as “conditionally eligible”. You will be covered for the next 90 days but you will be requested to provide\\xa0supporting documents\\xa0in order for the insurance or the subsidy to continue.\\nYour application may be processed for Medi-Cal insurance instead of the health plan you requested through Covered California. Usually, this action is taken if your IRS income records from the prior year were lower than the income listed on your application.\\n\\n*Note: Verification of immigration status will not be used for the purpose of enforcing immigration laws.\\nGet my free quote now!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth for California Insurance Center is licensed with the Department of Insurance and Covered California.

International travel health insurance provides medical protection for American citizens leaving their country as well as for non-Americans while they are traveling in the U.S. Many types of travelers can apply and get international travel health insurance: newlyweds on honeymoon, people on missionary trips, business travelers and many more.\\nNote that international travel health insurance enrollment is not subject to medical underwriting, so you can’t be denied for pre-existing conditions; however, be aware that pre-existing conditions are not covered.\\nHow does international medical insurance work?\\nGenerally speaking, a travel medical insurance policy helps you with expenses for sudden and unexpected injury and illness while you are traveling outside of your home country. Emergency travel benefits also include some non-medical expenses, such as lost luggage, lodging replacement due to a natural disaster, or assistance with a return trip home due to a covered incident. If a covered incident was to come up, you would pay out of pocket until you reach the deductible amount, if applicable. After the deductible is satisfied, then, the insurance company will pay 80% of the next $5,000 of covered expenses. After that point, the international travel medical insurance carrier will pay 100% of covered expenses up to the overall maximum limit. The maximum coverage period for international travel insurance is 365 days for non-US citizens or residents traveling outside of the U.S. or U.S. Territories. For all other members, the maximum coverage period is 364 days. The minimum age to enroll is 14 days old. We offer international travel health insurance through HCC Travel Medical Insurance Services, which syndicates with Lloyd’s of London to offer international coverage. Their plan offerings allow you to customize the policy. You select the deductible size, coverage limit, and the policy period you want.\\nWhat does international travel health insurance cover?\\nBelow are some common benefits on international travelers insurance. Note that restrictions apply and that this list is not all-inclusive.\\n\\nHospital charges for inpatient and outpatient services.\\nUrgent care in U.S. or Canada, providing it is not preventive or for a pre-existing condition.\\nPrescriptions related to a covered injury or illness. The cost to replace existing prescriptions due to loss, stolen, damaged, or expired medicines is not covered.\\nInternational Travel Medical Insurance covers health services rendered due to pregnancy complications.\\nMedical costs for an emergency medical evacuation.\\nTravel health insurance covers the return trip home if your trip is interrupted due to:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe death of an immediate family member.\\nYour home being severely destroyed.\\nA medical necessity.\\n\\n\\nEmergency dental services due to a covered accident.\\nMedical expenses for illness or injury resulting from terrorism.\\nReplacement accommodations if you are evacuated due to a natural disaster.\\nLost checked luggage.\\n\\nWhat is not covered under international travel health\\xa0insurance?\\n\\nAgain, this is not the whole list, but these are some of the main exclusions.\\n\\nMedical services for pre-existing health conditions.\\nTraditional emergency room visits, unless you are admitted to the hospital.\\nRoutine or preventative services.\\nPre-natal care services.\\nCosts that are over the usual, reasonable, and customary charges.\\nTravel insurance benefits do not apply while an American citizen is traveling in a U.S. state or territory.\\n\\nCan I cancel my travel health insurance?\\nTravel insurance can be cancelled. There is no cost if you cancel your travel insurance before the travel dates. If you request cancellation during the policy period, the premium will be pro-rated and a $25 cancellation fee added.\\nNote: If there is any discrepancy between the above information and the HCC policy provisions, the HCC policy provisions will prevail.\\n\\xa0\\nFor more information on temporary coverage, click Short Term Health Insurance.\\n\\nShort Term Health Insurance InformationGet a Free Travel Health Plan Quote\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, is a health care reform meant to make health insurance accessible and affordable to all. It provides Californians with better health security by setting up modifications that expand coverage and lower health care costs. It also ensures more choice and enhances the quality of care for all.\\nThe law has created marketplaces, popularly known as exchanges, where consumers can compare plans in an easier format. There are two kinds of marketplaces and the type you access will depend on the state where you live. There is the federal health insurance exchange (also known as Healthcare.gov), and then there are state-run marketplaces. California has its own state-run ACA marketplace, also known as Covered California.\\nAbout the Affordable Care Act\\nThe ACA overhauled America’s health care system, reducing national health care costs for individuals, families and the government. It addressed patients’ rights and protections and created new rules for the insurance industry.\\nThe ACA’s goals are to minimize the number of uninsured by making health care more affordable and improving the quality of available care.\\xa0Now all U.S. citizens, including legal immigrants, have access to health insurance.\\nU.S. Health Care Reform Timeline\\n\\n1965: Medicare and Medicaid legislation passes\\n1986: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act passes\\n1989-2007: Many proposals for Health Care Reform are considered\\n2008: Health Care Reform is a major topic during the general election\\nJanuary 20, 2009: Barack Obama is sworn into office as President\\nFebruary 2009: President Obama begins work on Health Care Reform\\n2009-2010: Ongoing congressional negotiations\\nMarch 23, 2010: The PPACA is signed into law by President Obama\\n2010-Future: The ACA rolls out in stages, mainly over the first 4 years\\n\\nCommon Terms Used to Refer to the Affordable Care Act\\nPeople refer to the Affordable Care Act by many different names:\\n\\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the full legal name\\nAffordable Care Act, a shorter version of the legal name\\nObamacare or Obama Health Care, common and informal terms\\nHealth Care Reform, a common name\\n\\n\\nWhy Did We Need the Affordable Care Act?\\nHistorically, the U.S has spent considerably more on its health care compared to other high-income countries in the world. Before the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965 was the last extensive U.S. health care reform legislation.\\nSome say that attempts to bring about reform go back to 1989 when the Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate and a market-based approach for health care. This proposal addressed the issues created by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in 1986, which required nearly all hospitals to provide emergency care to all who needed it, regardless of their ability to pay.\\nThe cost of treatment for those unable to pay was often passed to the government and individuals through higher insurance premiums and higher taxes. From 1989 through 2008, legislators proposed many attempts at health care reform. However, these attempts to effect any significant health care legislation failed.\\nCreating the ACA\\nPresident Obama made a big push in 2009 to have Congress construct the PPACA, a new health care reform law modeled in part on the Massachusetts Health Connector and the Healthy Americans ACT (HEART). The following topics were controversial subjects as the new law was being formed:\\n\\nThe Mandate\\nThe Health Insurance Penalty\\nUniversal health care\\nGuaranteed Issue\\nIndividual or Employer Mandate\\nSubsidy levels\\nFederal funding for birth control/abortion\\n\\nThe U.S. House and the Senate debated these health care reform issues until the ACA was finally signed into law on March 23, 2010.\\nTypes of Health Plans on the California Health Exchange\\nThe health plans offered on Covered California are divided into four metal tiers. The metal tiers reflect the costs you’re expected to pay in each category. They don’t have anything to do with the quality of care you will receive. \\n\\nThe metal tiers are as follows: \\n\\nBronze:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 60% of the health care costs, while you pay 40%. \\nSilver:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 70% of the health care costs, while you pay 30%. \\nGold:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 80% of the health care costs, while you pay 20%. \\nPlatinum:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 90% of the health care costs, while you pay 10%. \\n\\nEnhanced Silver Plans \\nCovered California also offers Enhanced Silver Plans for individuals with limited income who qualify for lower out-of-pocket costs. With Enhance Silver Plans, eligible individuals who enroll in the Silver plan get the benefits of Gold and Platinum plans but at the price of a silver plan. \\nEnhanced Silver Plans are divided into three categories: \\n\\nPlan 94%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 94%, and you pay 6%. \\nPlan 87%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 87%, and you pay 13%. \\nPlan 73%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 73%, and you pay 27%. \\n\\nMinimum Coverage Plans \\nThis is another coverage option you can qualify for if any of the following is true:\\n\\nYou are under 30 years of age. \\nYou can’t afford health coverage. \\nYou qualify for hardship exemption. \\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Cover? \\n\\nAll the health plans sold in the Covered California marketplace must meet the minimum coverage requirements. These requirements include: \\n\\nHospitalization services.\\nAmbulatory services.\\nUrgent and emergency care.\\nPrescription medications.\\nMaternity and breastfeeding support.\\nLaboratory services.\\nPreventative and wellness benefits.\\nMental health and drug abuse services.\\nPediatric services, including dental and vision care for kids.\\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Not Cover?\\nThe Affordable Care Act does leave two forms of insurance for adults out of its provisions — vision insurance and dental coverage. Although both of these services are considered essential benefits for children under the ACA, they are not included for adults.\\nStill, vision insurance is important coverage that you may consider adding to your plan. Supplemental dental coverage is also beneficial. Adults in California can purchase dental and vision coverage as health insurance supplements or stand-alone plans.\\nPatients’ Protections in the ACA California \\nObamacare in California came when many people found that the costs of medical care kept them from accessing it. Obamacare in California put policies in place that made medical coverage more accessible to everyone. You’ll find the following protections for patients in the ACA California:\\n\\nEveryone in California has access to health insurance.\\nPre-existing health conditions cannot deny anyone health coverage or extra charges.\\nChildren can be listed on their parent’s health plan until they are 26 years of age.\\nEmployers or businesses with more than 50 employees have to provide health insurance for their employees that meet the minimum requirements set by the government or risk paying penalties.\\nInsurance providers can no longer terminate your coverage because of a new health condition.\\nYou are free to choose your primary care doctor and out-of-network specialist services.\\nYou can compare prices through the state-run marketplace Covered California.\\nIt’s against the law for employers to fire you because you chose an Obamacare plan over the company’s plan.\\nYearly and lifetime dollar limits are no longer applicable for certain health benefits.\\nMany types of preventive care are free on all Marketplace plans.\\nYou can qualify for a tax credit to lower your monthly health insurance premium.\\nNew measures have been put in place to reduce fraud in Medicaid, Medicare and CHIP.\\n\\nBecause of the new law, people need to be aware of important factors such as income, tax filing status and where and when to apply.\\nAffordability of Health Care in California \\n\\nHealth insurance is mandatory for everyone in California and you might be subject to a penalty if you don’t have it. However, low-income California residents qualify for help with their health care costs. Depending on your income and eligibility, you may qualify for lower premiums. In addition to premiums, you may also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions, including coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. \\nTo get these savings, you should enroll through Covered California. Remember that those who qualify for cost-sharing reductions must enroll in Enhanced Silver Plans. These plans automatically enable you to pay lower coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. \\nTo qualify for financial assistance, you must: \\n\\nBe a U.S citizen or be legally present in the country.\\nEnroll for health coverage through Covered California.\\nNot be receiving Medicare, Medi-Cal or military health benefits.\\nNot have health coverage from your employer.\\nHave a household income that ranges between 100%-400% of the Federal Poverty Level.\\n\\nYou’ll also need to present a few documents before enrolling in California’s Obamacare:\\n\\nThe previous year’s tax information for you and your spouse.\\nA list of everyone in your household who will be on your federal tax return for the year you will be receiving coverage.\\nYour Social Security number or document numbers.\\n\\n\\nHow Can I Enroll for Health Coverage in California?\\nIf you are looking for health insurance in California, visit Covered California, the state health insurance marketplace.

With Enhance Silver Plans, eligible individuals who enroll in the Silver plan get the benefits of Gold and Platinum plans but at the price of a silver plan. \\nEnhanced Silver Plans are divided into three categories: \\n\\nPlan 94%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 94%, and you pay 6%. \\nPlan 87%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 87%, and you pay 13%. \\nPlan 73%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 73%, and you pay 27%. \\n\\nMinimum Coverage Plans \\nThis is another coverage option you can qualify for if any of the following is true:\\n\\nYou are under 30 years of age. \\nYou can’t afford health coverage. \\nYou qualify for hardship exemption. \\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Cover? \\n\\nAll the health plans sold in the Covered California marketplace must meet the minimum coverage requirements. These requirements include: \\n\\nHospitalization services.\\nAmbulatory services.\\nUrgent and emergency care.\\nPrescription medications.\\nMaternity and breastfeeding support.\\nLaboratory services.\\nPreventative and wellness benefits.\\nMental health and drug abuse services.\\nPediatric services, including dental and vision care for kids.\\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Not Cover?\\nThe Affordable Care Act does leave two forms of insurance for adults out of its provisions — vision insurance and dental coverage. Although both of these services are considered essential benefits for children under the ACA, they are not included for adults.\\nStill, vision insurance is important coverage that you may consider adding to your plan. Supplemental dental coverage is also beneficial. Adults in California can purchase dental and vision coverage as health insurance supplements or stand-alone plans.\\nPatients’ Protections in the ACA California \\nObamacare in California came when many people found that the costs of medical care kept them from accessing it. Obamacare in California put policies in place that made medical coverage more accessible to everyone. You’ll find the following protections for patients in the ACA California:\\n\\nEveryone in California has access to health insurance.\\nPre-existing health conditions cannot deny anyone health coverage or extra charges.\\nChildren can be listed on their parent’s health plan until they are 26 years of age.\\nEmployers or businesses with more than 50 employees have to provide health insurance for their employees that meet the minimum requirements set by the government or risk paying penalties.\\nInsurance providers can no longer terminate your coverage because of a new health condition.\\nYou are free to choose your primary care doctor and out-of-network specialist services.\\nYou can compare prices through the state-run marketplace Covered California.\\nIt’s against the law for employers to fire you because you chose an Obamacare plan over the company’s plan.\\nYearly and lifetime dollar limits are no longer applicable for certain health benefits.\\nMany types of preventive care are free on all Marketplace plans.\\nYou can qualify for a tax credit to lower your monthly health insurance premium.\\nNew measures have been put in place to reduce fraud in Medicaid, Medicare and CHIP.\\n\\nBecause of the new law, people need to be aware of important factors such as income, tax filing status and where and when to apply.\\nAffordability of Health Care in California \\n\\nHealth insurance is mandatory for everyone in California and you might be subject to a penalty if you don’t have it. However, low-income California residents qualify for help with their health care costs. Depending on your income and eligibility, you may qualify for lower premiums. In addition to premiums, you may also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions, including coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. \\nTo get these savings, you should enroll through Covered California. Remember that those who qualify for cost-sharing reductions must enroll in Enhanced Silver Plans. These plans automatically enable you to pay lower coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. \\nTo qualify for financial assistance, you must: \\n\\nBe a U.S citizen or be legally present in the country.\\nEnroll for health coverage through Covered California.\\nNot be receiving Medicare, Medi-Cal or military health benefits.\\nNot have health coverage from your employer.\\nHave a household income that ranges between 100%-400% of the Federal Poverty Level.\\n\\nYou’ll also need to present a few documents before enrolling in California’s Obamacare:\\n\\nThe previous year’s tax information for you and your spouse.\\nA list of everyone in your household who will be on your federal tax return for the year you will be receiving coverage.\\nYour Social Security number or document numbers.\\n\\n\\nHow Can I Enroll for Health Coverage in California?\\nIf you are looking for health insurance in California, visit Covered California, the state health insurance marketplace.

As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

Also, this legislation made greater discounts available.You can find the following types of plansIndividual and Family Healthcare Plans: Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, all non-grandfathered health plans must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements.

Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65.

Every carrier, it seemed, had their own method for categorizing prescriptions and determining what was covered and what wasn’t. Fortunately, the establishment of the Affordable Care Act has paved the way for many adjustments to our healthcare system that make securing and understanding coverage much simpler. One such adjustment focuses on Rx in hopes of improving member experience.\\nAs of January 1st 2016, all plans offered by Covered CA are required to use standardized formulary tier names and descriptions. While it may still seem daunting to understand, this is a huge step toward customers being able to compare apples to apples when shopping for a Health Plan. The tier structure is as follows:\\nRx Tiers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTier\\xa01\\nGeneric\\nMost generic drugs or low-cost, preferred brand drugs\\n\\n\\nTier\\xa02\\nPreferred brand\\nPreferred brand drugs or non-preferred generic drugs\\n\\n\\nTier\\xa03\\nNon-preferred brand\\nNon-preferred brand drugs or non-preferred generic drugs\\n\\n\\nTier\\xa04\\nSpecialty\\nSpecialty drugs or net drug cost per prescription >$600\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt’s important to keep in mind that while the formulary tier names and descriptions have been standardized, each carrier and health plan may still offer different levels of coverage. You’ll need to familiarize yourself with each plan and check the formulary list to determine the best fit for you and your family.\\nSeparate Rx Deductible on Bronze and Silver Plans\\nThe standard bronze and silver plans have a separate Rx deductible. For the standard bronze the deductible applies to all drug tiers. The silver Rx deductible is applicable to Silver 70, Silver 73 and Silver 87 plans and applies to all drug tiers except tier 1 for generic drugs.\\nRx Caps\\nSome drug tiers will have a cap on how much the member pays for each drug. The cap is called a “maximum per script.” The cap applies each time a prescription is refilled or until the maximum out-of-pocket is reached.\\nRx Coverage on Covered California Health Plans\\nSelect a plan below for Rx coverage info related to that health plan.\\n\\nMinimum Coverage/Catastrophic\\nBronze 60\\nBronze 60 HSA\\nSilver 70\\nSilver 73\\nSilver 87\\nSilver 94\\nGold 80\\nPlatinum 90\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

The government will not pick up the entire tab, but if you enroll in a Covered California health plan, depending on how much money you make, you may qualify for a subsidy that may\\xa0cover a considerable portion of your monthly premiums. If you make less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level in California, you qualify for Medi-Cal (otherwise known as Medicaid). If you make over that amount but less than 400% of the federal poverty level based on your household income and number of dependents, then you may\\xa0be eligible for an up-front subsidy (also referred to as a tax credit)1. View Covered California income limits to determine if you quality.\\nBasically, the government will pay for part of the premium and you will pick up the rest. The amount the government pays initially is dependent on your estimate of what your annual income is expected to be during the year that you apply for health insurance. If at tax time the next year, it turns out that you made less money than predicted, then you will get a tax credit. If you made more, then your taxes will increase to make up for the government’s overpayment on your subsidy. Whether or not you get a subsidy from the government is based on several\\xa0things: your household income, number of dependents and you being on a Covered California exchange plan.\\nFactors that Go into Getting a Government Subsidy for Your Health Plan\\n\\n How do I get my subsidy?\\nMost Californians will elect to get their subsidy up front each month. This means the full monthly amount of your subsidy will be deducted from your health insurance premiums. There are two other ways to receive your subsidy. You could deduct a partial amount (the percentage of your choice) from your premiums instead of taking 100% up front each month. This will not lower your monthly premium as much, but you could\\xa0receive a lump sum payment for the remainder come tax time the next year. Or, you can pay the full amount of your monthly premium and just collect your subsidy at tax time the next year in one large lump sum payment.\\nWhat if I made too much money to qualify for a subsidy?\\nSo what if I make more than 400% of the FPL? Why should I care about the Affordable Care Act? The reason you’ll care is not so you can get a subsidy, but so you can avoid the penalty. In your case there’s no carrot, but there is a stick, and the penalties get more and more severe as we get closer to 2017.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIn order to be eligible for the tax credit/subsidy you must not be eligible for any government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance program or military coverage and you must not work for an employer that offers health insurance coverage (unless the employer plan covers less than 60% of the cost of benefits).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

This means better benefits for you at the same monthly premium. For example, instead of paying a\\xa0$45\\xa0doctor visit, cost sharing may lower your doctor visit copayment down to $5. The less you make, the more cost sharing will save you at the point of service. The goal here is that people with low incomes won’t feel too big of an ouch when they go to use the services that are provided by their Covered California health care plan.\\nOnly Available on the Silver Plan\\nIf you qualify for cost sharing reduction through Obama Care California , you must choose a Silver Plan  to take advantage of this benefit. Covered California exchange plans  are “metallic plans”. From richest to least-benefits the plans are Platinum, Gold, Silver and Bronze. If you choose a Bronze Plan, your monthly premium will be the lowest, but the benefits on a Silver Plan are better, especially if you qualify for cost sharing reduction.\\n3 Tiers of Cost Sharing Reduction on the Silver Plan (73, 87 and 94)\\nThe standard Silver Plan covers 70% of your out-of-pocket costs. If you qualify for cost sharing reduction, you may qualify for the Silver 73 , the Silver 87 , or the Silver 94. The Silver 73 covers 73% of your out-of-pocket costs, 3% more \\xa0than the standard Silver Plan. However, if you qualify for a Silver 87 or a Silver 94, you will receive 87% or 94% coverage, which is 17% or 24% more of your out-of-pocket costs than the standard Silver Plan. For those who qualify for CSR, rarely would it make sense to purchase a Gold Plan . If you qualify for the Silver 87 or 94 and you “go for the gold”, you will be paying higher premiums for less benefits. The Silver 94 is even better than the Platinum Plan , which covers 90% of your out-of-pocket costs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Up front tax subsidies have made health insurance pricing more affordable than ever. To get your free quote, you will need to fill out a simple form, which takes less than two minutes to complete. You will enter your zip code, date of births and gender for each person in your household and your estimated annual income. You can get California health insurance quotes for just one individual or for the whole family at one time.\\xa0\\nWhat Determines My Rates\\nCovered California health insurance rates are based on your age, where you live, and what health plan you choose. For individual and family Obamacare quotes, even bigger factors are your household income and your family size. These determine your eligibility for tax subsidies, which help reduce your rates, as well as the cost for medical services. If your income falls below 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”), you may qualify for tax credits when you enroll through the California Marketplace. And if your income is below 250% of the federal poverty level, you may also qualify for better benefits at the same price, offered through Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) plans.\\n\\nHow to Get the Most Affordable Rates : Go Bronze or Go Catastrophic!\\n\\nThe most affordable Covered California health insurance quotes will be for “Bronze” and catastrophic plans. The Obamacare bronze plans will be a good consideration for people who don’t require frequent services; they will offer the highest deductible but also the most economical rates.\\nYour Covered CA medical insurance quote may include catastrophic, minimum essential coverage plans. These particular marketplace plans offer the cheapest coverage. These plans are available only to those who are under 30 years of age and to people who are unable to afford insurance due to a financial hardship.\\nMedical Insurance Quotes California\\xa0with\\xa0Government Subsidies\\nPeople whose family gross income is no more than 400% of the Federal Poverty Level (“FPL”) may qualify for tax credits from the government, and some may also qualify for lower service charges for office visits and other medical services. You can view Obamacare California rates and calculate your subsidy at the same time by getting an Covered Ca quote.\\nWill my business qualify for a tax credit?\\nSince the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, groups of 24 or fewer employees may qualify for a small business tax credit. This government assistance may enable your company to get a discount of up to 50% (35% for non-profits) off of the pricing you see on your Covered California quotes for small business. To be eligible for the Small Business Tax Credit, the company’s employees must earn an annual average wage of less than $50,000 and the employer must pay at least half of the employee-only premium. Enrollment must be done through the state exchange to get Covered California rates and to be eligible for this discount.

Health for California no longer offers these insurance plans, but you may still be able to get coverage if you missed open enrollment. During the open enrollment period, you also have plenty of alternative coverage options.\\nWhat Were Interim Insurance Plans?\\nShort-term health insurance plans offered health coverage to enrollees in need of urgent insurance while waiting to enroll in a standard health plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, this gap ins\\nurance no longer counts as qualifying coverage. You cannot apply for short-term coverage through Health for California. However, if you just experienced a sudden change in your insurance needs, you still have options.\\n\\n\\nQualifying Life Events When You Miss Open Enrollment\\nOutside of open enrollment, you can apply for insurance if you experience a\\xa0qualifying life event (QLE). QLEs are majo\\nr life changes or situations that could affect your insurance coverage, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss of health insurance:\\xa0When certain life changes cause you to lose insurance eligibility involuntarily, your situation might count as a QLE. Common examples of these types of QLEs include losing employer-sponsored coverage and aging out of a family plan.\\nPermanent move to/within California:\\xa0You qualify for enrollment when you move to California from another state. Some people who move from one part of California to another qualify when they have new Covered California plan options available to them at their new address.\\nNew child:\\xa0Having or adopting a child qualifies your entire family for special enrollment.\\nMarriage or domestic partnership:\\xa0When you get married or enter a domestic partnership, you and your partner may purchase a new health plan.\\nReturn from active-duty military service:\\xa0For 60 days after losing coverage from leaving active duty, reserve duty or the California National Guard, you qualify for special enrollment.\\nRelease from jail or prison:\\xa0You can purchase a health plan outside of open enrollment for 60 days after release from prison or jail.\\nNew citizenship or lawful presence:\\xa0You qualify for special enrollment if you become a permanent legal resident, citizen or national of the United States.\\nMembership of a federally recognized American Indian or Alaska Native tribe:\\xa0As an American Indian or Alaska Native who belongs to a federally recognized tribe, you can enroll at any time throughout the year and change health plans up to once a month.\\nOther QLEs/none of the above:\\xa0Many other situations that we list on our QLE page could qualify you for special enrollment. You can also apply for Medi-Cal or the Medi-Cal Access Program (MCAP) for pregnant women at any time if you don’t have a QLE.\\n\\n\\nOur Alternatives to Short-Term Health Plans\\nDuring the Covered California open enrollment period, We offer four tiers of insurance plans from the following providers:\\n\\nAnthem Blue Cross Covered California\\nBlue Shield Covered California\\nKaiser Permanente Covered California\\nMedi-Cal\\nOscar Health Plan of California\\nHealth Net Covered California\\nL.A.

Your FPL will be used by the Covered California Health Insurance Exchange to identify if you are eligible for a subsidy\\xa0and to determine the level of cost sharing that would apply, if any, for your\\xa0Covered CA Plan. People whose income is within a certain range of the federal poverty level will be able to get reduced monthly premiums and sometimes, lower fees for medical services also.\\nWhat is the Federal Poverty Level?\\nThe “Federal Poverty Level” (FPL) is the measurement standard that the Department of Health and Human Services uses to determine if an individual or family is eligible for government-regulated programs and services. Federal poverty level amounts are updated annually and are commonly published by various government agencies.\\n\\nHow do I qualify for reduced premiums and cost sharing?\\nTo qualify for a subsidy from the government, families must purchase their coverage through Covered California, and have a gross income no more than 400% of the federal poverty level.\\xa0To also qualify for cost sharing reductions, your family gross income must be more than 138% and less than 250% of the federal poverty level.

You want to pick the package that works best for you and your entire family. And with so many options and packages on the market, you may wonder where to begin. Health for California’s mission is to make this process easier for every Californian. We want you to feel confident about your decision, so we structure our plans for easy comparisons to help you find the one that meets your needs.\\nWe do this by breaking our health insurance plans down into easy-to-understand tiers.\\xa0Whether you’re a single individual wanting an affordable rate or you’re someone who wants maximum coverage for the whole family, there’s a package that’s perfect for you. Here are the tiers of Anthem Blue Cross coverage you can choose from:\\n\\nBronze 60 Plan: This plan is ideal for individuals who want to make small monthly payments in return for a small number of checkups and preventative care actions. Keep in mind that if you choose this plan, you’ll have to pay more upfront every time you see a specialist. If you have no dependents and expect few visits to the doctor this year, you can feel confident choosing the Bronze Plan.\\nSilver 70 Plan: Individuals who work hard to keep their health in good condition may want to choose the Silver Plan. In this plan, you’ll make average monthly payments to receive all the basics you might need as an individual in California. You’ll still have to pay out-of-pocket for hospital visits or outpatient surgeries.\\nGold 80 Plan: The Gold Plan is a great choice for individuals or small families looking for comprehensive coverage for modest monthly payments. While you may be paying more than the Bronze and Silver Plans, you’ll have a lower deductible every time you visit the hospital or see a specialist, which can save you more money over time.\\nPlatinum 90 Plan: When you choose the Platinum Plan, you’ll make higher monthly payments in exchange for top-tier health insurance coverage. This coverage includes regular visits to the physician or emergency room plus preventative care. And the best part is you get to skip the deductible and keep more money in your pocket. The Platinum Plan is perfect for families looking for great coverage while reducing their out-of-pocket expenses.\\n\\nTake the first step toward investing in your health by requesting an Anthem Blue Cross health insurance quote online from Health for California.\\nGET A QUOTE FOR ANTHEM BLUE CROSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

This legislation passed in Sacramento on July 15, 2021. It was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom twelve days later on July 27, 2021.\\nThus, the State of California will be paying the $1 PMPM in 2022 for Covered California enrollees.

Ambetter from Health Net is the customizable answer to your health care needs.\\nTo help you choose the right package, here’s a description of the Ambetter from Health Net insurance plans that are available:\\n\\nBronze 60 Plan: As one of the most affordable options available, this plan is perfect if you want to make small monthly payments while still receiving coverage for a few checkups and some preventative care. We understand you only want to pay for what you need. If you’re a young person with no dependents, this plan could be the answer you’ve been looking for. Keep in mind that you’ll have to pay out of pocket if you need to see a specialist.\\nSilver 70 Plan: After choosing the Silver Plan, you’ll make higher monthly payments than the Bronze Plan but receive more coverage benefits in return. The Silver Plan covers all the basics you could need and more for health care in California. Although, you will have to pay more when visiting the hospital or receiving outpatient surgery. Choose this plan if you’re the type of person who works hard to make sure you always have the health care you need.\\nGold 80 Plan: You’ll pay modest monthly payments after choosing the Gold Plan, and you’ll get excellent, comprehensive health care coverage as a result. You’ll enjoy low out-of-pocket costs when visiting the hospital or seeing a specialist. The lower deductible you’ll have to pay when health needs arise will allow you to save more money in the long run. And of course, saving more means having a bigger budget and more peace of mind for the future.\\nPlatinum 90 Plan: The Platinum Plan demands higher monthly payments, but the result is the highest level of care you can receive from Health Net. The benefits of this plan include handling emergencies, receiving preventative care and visiting the physician, all without having to pay a deductible. If you’re an individual looking to avoid out-of-pocket expenses for yourself or your family, then this plan is for you.\\n\\nRequest an Ambetter from Health Net health insurance quote\\xa0today to take the next step toward obtaining high-quality health care for you and your loved ones.

At 125% of Medicare fees, they were reimbursing at a level that was not sustainable. When HPR disbanded, their former members switched to other health insurance carriers, often to Kaiser Permanente which is the leading HMO in the Northern California area. Even consumers who switched to Health Net, Anthem Blue Cross or Blue Shield of California often ended up having to switch providers. For many doctors who had been getting a large percentage of their patients through HPR, this left them with a crippled practice and the need to rebuild their clientele. Northbaybiz.com commented on the situation:\\n\\n“The closure of a local HMO, Health Plan of the Redwoods—once Sonoma County’s premier health maintenance organization—zinged a lot of physicians. Even before the HPR bankruptcy, some doctors struggled to keep their practices open and pay their mortgages as the HMO and managed care environment deteriorated around them. Some packed up and left the state. Under the circumstances, it’s remarkable to me that, according to a recent survey, local doctors still devote nearly half of their time to offering care without adequate, or in some cases any, compensation. If doctors are no longer on the pedestal, they are still incredibly generous with their time and skills.”\\nThese doctors and the medical groups they were associated with (Mercy Medical Group, North Bay Healthcare, and UC Davis Medical Group) came together to form Western Health Advantage in an effort to regain the clients that they had lost through the collapse of Health Plan of the Redwoods. WHA, having learned their lesson from HPR, chose a reimbursement level around 116% of Medicare for sustainability.\\nWestern Health Advantage is an Accountable Care Organization (ACO). WHA partners with medical groups, hospitals, clinics and doctors. There is a fee for providers to join. Many providers have sought out WHA independently and paid this fee to join because they believe in the Western Health Advantage model. WHA uses 7% of premiums for administration costs, and paying commissions to insurance agents. The rest of the premiums are returned to the providers to insure they have the financial backing to provide excellent care.\\nWHA started by offering health care coverage to small companies. In the 90’s, they added some large groups including some municipalities and school districts. In the last few years, they also added individual and family coverage. They attribute their success largely to their values and their core senior team that has remained with WHA since their inception in 1996. Some of their values include:\\n\\nNo narrow networks\\nPay doctors well\\nGive great customer service to members\\n\\nNo Medicare or Medi-cal Through Western Health Advantage\\nWHA stopped offering Medicare and Medi-Cal coverage in 2007 because they were not profitable for their providers. This means that their members usually leave them when they hit 65 or when their income drops to the point where they end up going on Medi-Cal (California’s version of Medicaid). WHA is considering bringing this coverage back in the future, but currently there are no plans to do so.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

They want to know why the benefits and rates have changed so drastically. We’ve got a quick overview of everything you need to know below.\\n4 Things You Need to Know About Obamacare and Group Health California\\nHere’s what to know and understand:\\n1. Obamacare Has Changed the Way Insurance Providers Calculate Rates for Group Medical Insurance\\n\\nBefore 2014, all small group medical insurance plan rates were based on the age of an employee. For instance, if an employee fell within the age range of 20-29, 30-39, etc., then there was a single rate for that age range. \\nAdditionally, it didn’t matter how many children the employee had or if their spouse was young or old. There was one rate for the whole family, and everything was based on the age of the employee. This is no longer the case. Now, the rate for small group medical insurance is based on the exact age of the employee as well as the age of the spouse and children.\\xa0\\nKeep in mind that the ACA also eliminated the consideration of pre-existing medical conditions as a basis for determining health rates. In California, this means that the “Risk Adjustment Factor,” which allowed rates to vary by your pre-existing medical conditions, was eliminated. Now, it doesn’t matter if your employees are in good health or not. You get the same rates.\\n2. Obamacare Uses Standard Benefits and Metallic Tiers to Compare Health Plan Benefits \\nMedical insurance is not only complicated, but it’s also expensive. To help people understand the plans and compare one plan with another, Covered California uses a standardized model to determine the rates an insurance plan pays for physician visits, hospitalizations and other benefits. \\nThe result is an AV (Actuarial Value) which sorts the plan into four different categories: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. A Platinum plan is the most beneficial plan, which means the insurance plan pays most of the costs while the patient pays the least. In a Platinum plan, the insurance provider pays 90% while you pay 10%. In a Bronze Plan, the insurance pays 60% while you pay 40%. The ACA does not allow plans that cover less than 60% of the health costs.\\n3. Insurance Providers Use Physicians and Hospital Networks to Reduce Costs of Plans \\nHealth care costs vary dramatically between physicians and hospitals. Some are inexpensive, and others are expensive. Health insurance plans that include low-cost providers charge less than those that include high-cost ones. \\nBy enrolling in a health plan that excludes expensive doctors and hospitals, employees can get comprehensive benefits at a modest cost.\\n4. Small Employers Can Offer a Range of Health Insurance Plans to Meet Employees’ Needs \\nEmployees have different needs when it comes to health insurance. Some employees never visit the doctor and only need catastrophic coverage. Others have serious illnesses like diabetes and need a health plan that can cover most of their needs with little contribution from them. The good news is that an employer can tailor insurance plan benefits to meet the needs of the company as well as those of the employees. \\nSome employers can offer a single plan to every employee. Others can offer single HMO or PPO plans. Still, others can offer four to six different plans and allow the employees to choose the one that fits their needs. We understand that offering five to six plans can get quite overwhelming for employees, but insurance providers allow small employers to offer 15 or more plans while minimizing the cost to the employer.\\n\\nSmall Business Enrollment Applications for Employers and Employees\\nUse the links below to enroll in small business health insurance through Covered California including dental:\\n\\nCovered CA Small Business – Employer Application – Enroll your business.\\nEmployee Application – Enroll specific employees on the health plan.\\n\\nCovered California for Small Business\\n\\nYou’re eligible for Covered California for your small business if:\\n\\nYou have at least one W-2 employee, in addition to owners, officers or spouse thereof.\\nFederal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).\\nPayroll Records\\n\\nGet Group Health Insurance Quotes in California\\n\\nRunning a small business is difficult enough without all the confusion that group health insurance can bring.

That means you can go to any provider in the country as long as they take Medicare.\\nSign Up for a Webinar\\nSchedule a Consultation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are eligible for Medicare, you get what is called Original Medicare, Parts A and B Benefits. The Part A Benefit covers in-patient hospitalization and the Part B Benefit covers out-patient doctor visits. However, you have minimal coverage and no out-of-pocket maximum. That means there is no limit to your potential health care costs.\\xa0\\nSo, most people will add a Medicare Advantage Plan or a Supplemental Plan to fill in the gaps in coverage that are left by the Part A and Part B benefits. Thus, these supplemental plans are often called Medigap plans.\\nMedication expenses are not covered on these plans. For prescription drugs, you would need to add a Medicare Part D benefit (or choose Medicare Advantage). Be careful not to confuse the Part D drug coverage with the Supplemental D health coverage.\\nWhat Supplement Plans are available?\\nOriginal Medicare Benefits A and B are already included. Be careful not to get these confused with the Supplemental Plans A and B, which are different. The supplement plans (A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N), also known as Medigap Plans, fill in the gaps left by Original Medicare.\\nPeople choose the Supplemental Plans because they give them more flexibility and control. There are more providers available and more options for treatments.\\n\\n\\n\\nMedigap Plans include the following:\\nA – This minimal coverage plan adds blood work coverage as well as hospice coinsurance/copayments.\\nB – This is the same as A, except that it also pays for the A deductible ($1,556 in 2022).\\nC – In general, C is not available to people born in 1955 or later. Younger people may have gotten this Medigap Plan if they received Medicare earlier due to a disability. This is a fairly comprehensive plan, just a step down from F and G. It includes all the Medicare supplemental benefits with one exception. It does not pay for the excess doctor fees that are not covered by the Medicare B Benefit.\\nD – This supplemental health plan covers all the Medicare supplemental benefits, with the exception of the Medicare B deductible and excess charges.\\nF – This insurance plan has the most coverage but it is not currently available. In general, F is not available to people born in 1955 or later (younger persons may have gotten this Medigap coverage if they received Medicare earlier due to a disability).\\nG – This Medicare insurance coverage offers the highest level of benefits currently available. We recommend G over C and F. F often costs $30 or more per month, when compared to G. And, the only difference is that G doesn’t pay for the B Benefit deducible ($233 in 2022). If a doctor charges an excess fee, that is covered by G.\\xa0\\nK & L – These plans cover a percentage of the gaps in Original Medicare coverage. K covers 50% and L covers 75%. They do not include B deductible or excess charges, and they do not include Foreign Travel Emergency.\\nM – This medical coverage is the same as D, except for the fact that it only pays for 50% of the A Benefit Deductible ($1,556 in 2022). It does not cover the B deductible or excess charges.\\nN – This supplemental insurance plan is the same as D, except for the B Benefit where it includes a $20 copay for office visits and a $50 copay for emergency room visits.\\nWhy are F and G the most popular?\\nPeople looking for Medicare Supplement Plans are usually wanting a higher level of health care coverage. F is the most comprehensive plan, but you will usually save a little money by going with G, which is the next most comprehensive plan and has a good price point. The cost for G is often not much more than the next level down.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nOther Things to Note About the Supplemental Plans\\nK and A offer the least coverage. They tend to have the lowest monthly premiums.\\nN is the next best seller after G and F. N has good coverage, but you do have to pay a copay for doctor and emergency visits. If a doctor charges an excess fee, that is not covered by N. For many consumers, the decision comes down to the choice between F, G and N. How these three are priced in your area, will help you determine which is best for you.\\nBe aware that you cannot to have more than one Medigap Plan. For instance, if you choose G, you can’t also have C. However, it would not make sense financially to have two supplemental plans anyway. You would be paying extra premium for duplicated coverage.\\nMedicare Advantage Benefit C is considered a full coverage plan. You cannot add (to an Advantage Plan) the D Prescription Drug Benefit or any of the supplemental plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also called the Affordable Care Act (ACA) or Obamacare, is a health care reform meant to make health insurance accessible and affordable to all. It provides Californians with better health security by setting up modifications that expand coverage and lower health care costs. It also ensures more choice and enhances the quality of care for all.\\nThe law has created marketplaces, popularly known as exchanges, where consumers can compare plans in an easier format. There are two kinds of marketplaces and the type you access will depend on the state where you live. There is the federal health insurance exchange (also known as Healthcare.gov), and then there are state-run marketplaces. California has its own state-run ACA marketplace, also known as Covered California.\\nAbout the Affordable Care Act\\nThe ACA overhauled America’s health care system, reducing national health care costs for individuals, families and the government. It addressed patients’ rights and protections and created new rules for the insurance industry.\\nThe ACA’s goals are to minimize the number of uninsured by making health care more affordable and improving the quality of available care.\\xa0Now all U.S. citizens, including legal immigrants, have access to health insurance.\\nU.S. Health Care Reform Timeline\\n\\n1965: Medicare and Medicaid legislation passes\\n1986: Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act passes\\n1989-2007: Many proposals for Health Care Reform are considered\\n2008: Health Care Reform is a major topic during the general election\\nJanuary 20, 2009: Barack Obama is sworn into office as President\\nFebruary 2009: President Obama begins work on Health Care Reform\\n2009-2010: Ongoing congressional negotiations\\nMarch 23, 2010: The PPACA is signed into law by President Obama\\n2010-Future: The ACA rolls out in stages, mainly over the first 4 years\\n\\nCommon Terms Used to Refer to the Affordable Care Act\\nPeople refer to the Affordable Care Act by many different names:\\n\\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the full legal name\\nAffordable Care Act, a shorter version of the legal name\\nObamacare or Obama Health Care, common and informal terms\\nHealth Care Reform, a common name\\n\\n\\nWhy Did We Need the Affordable Care Act?\\nHistorically, the U.S has spent considerably more on its health care compared to other high-income countries in the world. Before the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid Act of 1965 was the last extensive U.S. health care reform legislation.\\nSome say that attempts to bring about reform go back to 1989 when the Heritage Foundation proposed an individual mandate and a market-based approach for health care. This proposal addressed the issues created by the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA) in 1986, which required nearly all hospitals to provide emergency care to all who needed it, regardless of their ability to pay.\\nThe cost of treatment for those unable to pay was often passed to the government and individuals through higher insurance premiums and higher taxes. From 1989 through 2008, legislators proposed many attempts at health care reform. However, these attempts to effect any significant health care legislation failed.\\nCreating the ACA\\nPresident Obama made a big push in 2009 to have Congress construct the PPACA, a new health care reform law modeled in part on the Massachusetts Health Connector and the Healthy Americans ACT (HEART). The following topics were controversial subjects as the new law was being formed:\\n\\nThe Mandate\\nThe Health Insurance Penalty\\nUniversal health care\\nGuaranteed Issue\\nIndividual or Employer Mandate\\nSubsidy levels\\nFederal funding for birth control/abortion\\n\\nThe U.S. House and the Senate debated these health care reform issues until the ACA was finally signed into law on March 23, 2010.\\nTypes of Health Plans on the California Health Exchange\\nThe health plans offered on Covered California are divided into four metal tiers. The metal tiers reflect the costs you’re expected to pay in each category. They don’t have anything to do with the quality of care you will receive. \\n\\nThe metal tiers are as follows: \\n\\nBronze:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 60% of the health care costs, while you pay 40%. \\nSilver:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 70% of the health care costs, while you pay 30%. \\nGold:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 80% of the health care costs, while you pay 20%. \\nPlatinum:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 90% of the health care costs, while you pay 10%. \\n\\nEnhanced Silver Plans \\nCovered California also offers Enhanced Silver Plans for individuals with limited income who qualify for lower out-of-pocket costs. With Enhance Silver Plans, eligible individuals who enroll in the Silver plan get the benefits of Gold and Platinum plans but at the price of a silver plan. \\nEnhanced Silver Plans are divided into three categories: \\n\\nPlan 94%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 94%, and you pay 6%. \\nPlan 87%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 87%, and you pay 13%. \\nPlan 73%:\\xa0On average, your plan pays 73%, and you pay 27%. \\n\\nMinimum Coverage Plans \\nThis is another coverage option you can qualify for if any of the following is true:\\n\\nYou are under 30 years of age. \\nYou can’t afford health coverage. \\nYou qualify for hardship exemption. \\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Cover? \\n\\nAll the health plans sold in the Covered California marketplace must meet the minimum coverage requirements. These requirements include: \\n\\nHospitalization services.\\nAmbulatory services.\\nUrgent and emergency care.\\nPrescription medications.\\nMaternity and breastfeeding support.\\nLaboratory services.\\nPreventative and wellness benefits.\\nMental health and drug abuse services.\\nPediatric services, including dental and vision care for kids.\\n\\nWhat Benefits Does the Affordable Care Act Not Cover?\\nThe Affordable Care Act does leave two forms of insurance for adults out of its provisions — vision insurance and dental coverage. Although both of these services are considered essential benefits for children under the ACA, they are not included for adults.\\nStill, vision insurance is important coverage that you may consider adding to your plan. Supplemental dental coverage is also beneficial. Adults in California can purchase dental and vision coverage as health insurance supplements or stand-alone plans.\\nPatients’ Protections in the ACA California \\nObamacare in California came when many people found that the costs of medical care kept them from accessing it. Obamacare in California put policies in place that made medical coverage more accessible to everyone. You’ll find the following protections for patients in the ACA California:\\n\\nEveryone in California has access to health insurance.\\nPre-existing health conditions cannot deny anyone health coverage or extra charges.\\nChildren can be listed on their parent’s health plan until they are 26 years of age.\\nEmployers or businesses with more than 50 employees have to provide health insurance for their employees that meet the minimum requirements set by the government or risk paying penalties.\\nInsurance providers can no longer terminate your coverage because of a new health condition.\\nYou are free to choose your primary care doctor and out-of-network specialist services.\\nYou can compare prices through the state-run marketplace Covered California.\\nIt’s against the law for employers to fire you because you chose an Obamacare plan over the company’s plan.\\nYearly and lifetime dollar limits are no longer applicable for certain health benefits.\\nMany types of preventive care are free on all Marketplace plans.\\nYou can qualify for a tax credit to lower your monthly health insurance premium.\\nNew measures have been put in place to reduce fraud in Medicaid, Medicare and CHIP.\\n\\nBecause of the new law, people need to be aware of important factors such as income, tax filing status and where and when to apply.\\nAffordability of Health Care in California \\n\\nHealth insurance is mandatory for everyone in California and you might be subject to a penalty if you don’t have it. However, low-income California residents qualify for help with their health care costs. Depending on your income and eligibility, you may qualify for lower premiums. In addition to premiums, you may also be eligible for cost-sharing reductions, including coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. \\nTo get these savings, you should enroll through Covered California. Remember that those who qualify for cost-sharing reductions must enroll in Enhanced Silver Plans. These plans automatically enable you to pay lower coinsurance, copayments, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. \\nTo qualify for financial assistance, you must: \\n\\nBe a U.S citizen or be legally present in the country.\\nEnroll for health coverage through Covered California.\\nNot be receiving Medicare, Medi-Cal or military health benefits.\\nNot have health coverage from your employer.\\nHave a household income that ranges between 100%-400% of the Federal Poverty Level.\\n\\nYou’ll also need to present a few documents before enrolling in California’s Obamacare:\\n\\nThe previous year’s tax information for you and your spouse.\\nA list of everyone in your household who will be on your federal tax return for the year you will be receiving coverage.\\nYour Social Security number or document numbers.\\n\\n\\nHow Can I Enroll for Health Coverage in California?\\nIf you are looking for health insurance in California, visit Covered California, the state health insurance marketplace.

Also, it gives you the peace of mind of knowing you have coverage in the case of a “catastrophic event”.\\xa0 Without coverage, you could end up with a medical bill in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, but with this plan, the highest your medical bill could reach in one year is $7,800 for one person or $15,600 for a family\\xa0on the standard Bronze Plan, or $6,550 for one person or $13,100 for a family on the Bronze HDHP/HSA Plan.\\nHowever, with lower premiums come higher out-of-pocket costs when you need to use medical services like the emergency room, etc. Most services are subject to the deductible. This means that you will be responsible to pay full price for your services until the deductible is met. For example, you will pay full price for x-rays and emergency room visits until you have reached your deductible.\\nHighlights of the Bronze Plan\\n\\n\\nThe standard Bronze Plan gives you the first 3 cumulative office visits (primary care, specialist, mental health and urgent care visit) for a copay of $65-$95. Note: The HSA Bronze Plan does not include this benefit.\\n\\n\\nThe Bronze plans (like all of the plans) includes free preventative care such as annual physicals (including mammograms and colonoscopies), well-baby checkups, and immunizations.\\n\\n\\nBasic pediatric vision and dental preventative services are included at no charge for children 18 and under.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Types of Bronze Plans\\nCovered California offers 2 Bronze 60 Plans:\\xa0The regular\\xa0Bronze 60 Plan and a Bronze Plan compatible with a Health Savings Account called the Bronze 60 HDHP/HSA plan.\\n\\nBronze 60 Plan – check out this plan for additional limited benefits that are not subject to the deductible.\\nBronze 60 HDHP/HSA Plan – check out this plan for additional tax benefits.\\n\\nIs the Bronze 60 Plan Right for Me?\\nThis plan may be right for you if:\\n\\nYou want a low monthly premium.\\nYou are comfortable with a high deductible,\\xa0and you mainly want a catastrophic plan.\\nYou are not regularly taking costly prescription drugs.\\nYou are in good health and typically use very few medical services in a year.\\nYour goal is to comply with the Individual Mandate to have health insurance verses having\\xa0the richest benefits.\\nYour income qualifies you for a subsidy but you do not qualify for Enhanced Silver Plan.\\nYour income does not qualify you for a subsidy and you are age 50 or\\xa0over. Note: At this age the cost difference between the Bronze and the Silver plans is often greater than $100.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\n\\nIf your income does not qualify you for a premium tax credit and you are under age 30, consider the Minimum Coverage Plan\\nIf your income qualifies you for an Enhanced Silver Plan, consider this plan and weigh the added out-of-pocket savings to the premium savings of the Bronze plan.\\nIf you typically use a lot of prescriptions, doctor visits, or other medical services, you may want to consider a Silver, Gold or Platinum.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

The effect went into place on January 1, 2019, meaning that those who were uninsured in 2019 no longer had to pay tax penalties, but those who were uninsured in 2018 still had to pay the fine.\\nLooking for ACA compliant coverage? Get a free quote\\nBefore 2019, the Affordable Care Act required U.S. taxpayers to sign up for health insurance coverage or face penalization come tax time. Many who wanted to avoid the tax penalty chose to apply for a valid exemption or enroll in a qualified health plan in time for tax season.\\nFor those who remained uninsured for part of the calendar year, some remained exempt due to their uninsured status being less than three consecutive months. Others were exempt from penalties due to their part in a federally recognized Native American tribe,\\xa0a grandfathered plan\\xa0or a\\xa0Health Care Sharing\\xa0Ministry (HCSM).\\nIn 2023, you are no\\xa0longer required to pay a federal tax penalty\\xa0for remaining uninsured. However, that may not apply to you if you live in a specific state. For those in California, you are still required to have health insurance and could be subject to a fee should you remain uninsured.\\nWhat Is the Health Insurance Penalty\\xa0in California?\\nThe penalty for not having health insurance increases every year. You may want to decide whether it is worth paying the penalty or enrolling in an ACA-compliant California health insurance plan. Here are the ways tax penalties have increased each year:\\n\\n2015:\\xa0The penalty was around\\xa0$325 per adult and $162.50 per child\\xa0or\\xa02% of your taxable household income minus the federal tax-filing threshold. This was the minimum income required by the IRS for someone to file an income tax return.\\n2016:\\xa0The penalty rose to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child or 2.5% of your taxable household income minus the federal tax-filing threshold.\\n2017 to 2018:\\xa0The penalty increased to\\xa0$695 per adult and $347.50 per child, plus COLA (“Cost of Living Adjustment”) or 2.5% of your taxable household income minus the federal tax-filing threshold.\\n2019:\\xa0In 2019, the tax fees were rescinded, meaning those uninsured wouldn’t have to pay fines during the year.\\n2020 to 2022:\\xa0In 2020, California again required that taxpayers\\xa0enroll in health insurance\\xa0or face penalties during tax season. Depending on your income, fees could be around\\xa0$800 per adult and $400 per dependent child\\xa0or anyone under 18 in the household who relies on you for income. Or, you’ll be required to pay 2.5% of your gross income that’s above the filing threshold, which is based on how many dependents you have and your tax filing status. You’ll pay whichever is higher.\\n2023:\\xa0A flat amount based on the number of people in the household, $850 per adult 18 years or older and $425 per dependent child, up to\\xa0an annual max of $2,550.\\n\\nWhat Are My Options for Complying With Obamacare?\\nYou have options when it comes to complying with Obamacare:\\n\\nGet no insurance:\\xa0You’ll still have to pay the penalty at tax time in California. Consider carefully before choosing this option.\\nGet cheap insurance:\\xa0Remember that a cheap insurance plan often won’t meet minimum essential benefits requirements, and you might still have to pay the penalty at tax time.\\nEnroll in a qualified health plan:\\xa0This option does not have to be through Covered California to avoid the penalty, but it must\\xa0be a Covered California plan to\\xa0qualify for a government subsidy.\\nEnroll in a Health Care Sharing Plan (HCSP):\\xa0An HCSP exempts you from the tax penalty\\xa0and may offer lower premiums than traditional health insurance plans.\\n\\n\\nHealth Insurance Penalty\\xa0Options\\nBecause penalties may be comparatively low, some California residents opt to pay the fine and go without health insurance coverage. Another option some choose is to get cheap coverage, or one that won’t meet the minimum essential benefits requirements and still pay the penalty. In many cases, it may be beneficial to compare your penalty for remaining uninsured versus paying health insurance plans monthly.\\nFor example, if in the tax year 2015, you were single, aged under 65, had a taxable income of $50,000 and were uninsured the whole year, your penalty would have been calculated as\\xa0follows —\\xa0The greater of $395 or $50,000 income minus $10,150 Federal Minimum Threshold,\\xa0equals\\xa0$39,850 x 2%\\xa0and equals\\xa0a $797 penalty. In this scenario, your tax penalty would be $797.\\nIf you remained uninsured in 2017, your penalty would go up to approximately $996 depending on the Cost of Living Adjustment and the Federal Minimum Threshold. At $996 per year, that is only about $83 per month.\\nIf you compare that penalty with paying a theoretical $375 a month for a Covered California plan, it may make sense to pay the\\xa0tax\\xa0penalty for no health insurance.\\xa0However, in 2023, the cost of paying monthly health insurance versus paying a fee at tax time is something that should be weighed and calculated carefully.\\nReach out to us directly with questions about the uninsured penalty\\n\\nFind Reliable Healthcare Plans Through Health for California\\nHealth for California Insurance Center has operated in California since 2004.

Western Health Advantage does not offer coverage in San Francisco, so UCSF would not be one of the offered providers. The provider list is determined based on the areas where Western Health Advantage is licensed.\\nHowever, there may be an exception to the rule. If your doctor or specialist referred you for a procedure that was not offered by any of the physicians or medical facilities in the network, then Western Health Advantage may approve an out-of-county specialist like the University of California San Francisco. One representative from WHA said, “I have seen a liver transplant referred out to UCSF.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

It is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).\\n\\n\\n\\nApply Now\\n\\n\\nWhat Is Medi-Cal?\\nEach state runs part of the health care program Medicaid, and Medi-Cal is the version available to qualified individuals in California. With\\xa0Medicaid for California,\\xa0if you qualify and apply, can help you pay for doctor’s visits, medication, dental screenings, rehabilitation, surgery, visits to the hospital and more.\\nWho Is Responsible for Medi-Cal?\\n\\nCounty human services departments are responsible for administering the Medi-Cal program at the local level. Recent reports state that\\xa0more than\\xa014\\xa0million Californians\\xa0are eligible for enrollment in\\xa0Medi-Cal.\\xa0Approximately one-third of the state’s population is enrolled in Medi-Cal.\\xa0More than 80% of enrollees\\xa0have coverage through the managed care plan while the rest use a fee-for-service system to access care.\\nGetting Started With Medi-Cal Enrollment\\nIf you’re eligible for Medi-Cal,\\xa0Health for California can help you with your application. We’ll help you apply for a quote online, and our simple application is fast and accurate, so you’ll get the information you need right away. If you need coverage and may qualify for Medi-Cal or would like to compare plans,\\xa0get a quote from us.\\nApplying for Medi-Cal\\nYou have several options if you want to apply for Medi-Cal. The first step is usually to determine if you’re eligible for the coverage. To do that, look at your household income or review any other programs you qualify for in California.\\nIf you\\xa0 meet the income requirements or are eligible because of your health or age, you can apply for coverage in the following ways:\\n\\nBy mail\\nIn person\\nOnline\\n\\nWhat Do I Need to Apply?\\nWhen you apply, you’ll need to provide information about yourself and your family. Some of the details you’ll be asked for include:\\n\\nSocial security numbers:\\xa0You’ll need the Social Security number for each person in your family or those who are part of the application. If you’re an immigrant without a Social Security number, you’ll need to provide your document information instead.\\nEmployment details:\\xa0You must provide information about your employment status and income with your application. If more than one person in the household works, provide employment details for each person, as their income can affect your overall eligibility.\\nFederal tax information:\\xa0You’ll also have to provide your federal tax details, such as your filing status and the number of dependents you claim on your return.\\nOther health insurance:\\xa0If you have health insurance through a job or another insurance policy, you’ll be asked to include information about it on your application.\\n\\nIt’s important to provide as much of the requested information as possible when you submit your application. Not having certain details, such as your tax information or employment information, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply. It’s often better to send in your application with as much information as you have than not to apply at all.\\xa0In fact, you can still get coverage for your children even if you are an undocumented immigrant. You can also be eligible for coverage even if you don’t file a tax return.\\n\\nWhat Is on the Application?\\nAs you fill out the application, it will ask you to provide personal information about everyone in your home. The application will ask for the following:\\n\\nAddress\\nPreferred language\\nWhether you or others in your family have a disability\\nCitizenship or immigration status\\nEmployment and income information\\nRace and ethnicity\\nVeteran status\\nBirthday\\n\\nIf you feel confused about any of the questions on the application or need assistance,\\xa0Health for California\\xa0is here to help. If you know you’re eligible for Medi-Cal, it can be worth applying anyway, as you might qualify for a subsidized health insurance plan if you end up not qualifying for Medi-Cal.\\nMedi-Cal Insurance: Understanding the Basics\\nCalifornia has the nation’s largest Medicaid program. There was a huge increase in Medi-Cal enrollments largely due to the expansion that California opted into after the Affordable Care Act was passed which gives aid to a larger range of people. Now, people with slightly higher income are able to receive Medi-Cal regardless of disability, family status, financial resources, and other factors that were usually taken into account in eligibility decisions.\\nMedi-Cal for Immigrants\\nAs of\\xa0May 1, 2016, California’s undocumented low-income children (under the age of 19)\\xa0have access\\xa0to full coverage through Medi-Cal.\\nMost\\xa0adults who are undocumented\\xa0do not qualify for Medi-Cal. However, they may qualify for some of the coverage during pregnancy or emergencies.\\nIn most cases, adults who are immigrants and have been legal residents for at least five years or meet other requirements qualify for Medi-Cal. However, even immigrants who are legal residents but do not qualify for Medi-Cal may qualify for assistance in getting insurance if they’re at or below 400 percent of the FPL (Federal Poverty Level).\\nWhat May Be Covered by Medi-Cal?\\nMedi-Cal provides a range of health benefits, including the following 10 “essential health benefits” required by the Affordable Care Act for all health plans:\\n\\nOutpatient (ambulatory) services\\nEmergency services\\nHospitalization\\nMaternity and newborn care\\nMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment\\nPrescription drugs\\nPrograms such as physical and occupational therapy (known as rehabilitative and habilitative services) and devices\\nLaboratory services\\nPreventive and wellness services and chronic disease management\\nChildren’s services, including oral and vision care\\n\\n\\xa0\\nUnderstanding Your Medi-Cal Benefits\\n\\nYour Medi-Cal benefits will depend on how you qualify for Medi-Cal. Some patients get full-scope Medi-Cal, meaning they qualify for all Medi-Cal coverage. Some patients eligible for partial-scope Medi-Cal will be covered only for some services. It’s important to understand what is and what may not be covered for you.\\nThe\\xa0Medi-Cal Health Benefits Chart\\xa0provides more details about specific services in the above categories. Medi-Cal also offers certain dental benefits for adults and children, and full-scope Medi-Cal members are offered vison benefits.\\nYour Medi-Cal benefits will depend on how you\\xa0qualify for Medi-Cal. Some patients get full-scope Medi-Cal, meaning they qualify for all Medi-Cal coverage. Some patients eligible for partial-scope Medi-Cal will be covered only for some services. It’s important to understand what is and what may not be covered for you.\\nMedi-Cal also offers certain dental benefits for adults and children, and full-scope Medi-Cal members are offered vison benefits.\\nTo improve its services, the DHCS states that to improve members’ access to services and to ensure they spend tax dollars efficiently, “nearly 80 percent of its members now receive care from a Medi-Cal managed care plan. Under these models access to health care is easier and the quality of care is improved.”*\\nHow You Get Medical Care Under Medi-Cal\\nPlan options vary depending on the county you reside in. Most counties offer commercial plans including Anthem Blue Cross, Kaiser Permanente, Health Net, and Molina. Other counties offer public plans administered by the community. If a county only administers one plan, then all Medi-Cal members will be enrolled in that plan. Almost all Medi-Cal plans are “managed care plans” which means they function similar to an HMO. Medi-Cal Plans can be found in the\\xa0Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Plan Directory.\\nA managed care plan means you’ll have a primary care physician, and they’re the one person you’ll see if you need medical care. If you need to see another doctor or specialist, your primary care physician must refer you to that medical care provider if you want that visit covered by Medi-Cal. In the event of an emergency, however, you are not limited to a specific hospital.\\nAfter You Have Selected a Plan\\nOnce the plan is selected, a doctor or doctor’s group must be chosen. Medi-Cal members must use a Medi-Cal doctor and facility that is in the group and plan that they have been enrolled in. Members can\\xa0search for Medi-Cal Doctors\\xa0on the Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Care Options Website.\\nIn some areas, only “Fee-For-Service” Medi-Cal is offered – contact Medi-Cal for how Fee-For-Service Medi-Cal works.\\nThe Future is Here\\nThe California DHCS seeks to fulfill its vital role as California’s health care safety net by having the following mission and vision:\\n“…to provide Californians with access to affordable high-quality health care, including medical, dental, mental health, substance use disorder services, and long-term services and supports…and to preserve and improve the physical and mental health of all Californians.” *\\nIf you’re ready to sign up for Medi-Cal or another health insurance program,\\xa0get a quote\\xa0from Health for California today.

Health for California no longer offers these insurance plans, but you may still be able to get coverage if you missed open enrollment. During the open enrollment period, you also have plenty of alternative coverage options.\\nWhat Were Interim Insurance Plans?\\nShort-term health insurance plans offered health coverage to enrollees in need of urgent insurance while waiting to enroll in a standard health plan. Under the Affordable Care Act, this gap ins\\nurance no longer counts as qualifying coverage. You cannot apply for short-term coverage through Health for California. However, if you just experienced a sudden change in your insurance needs, you still have options.\\n\\n\\nQualifying Life Events When You Miss Open Enrollment\\nOutside of open enrollment, you can apply for insurance if you experience a\\xa0qualifying life event (QLE). QLEs are majo\\nr life changes or situations that could affect your insurance coverage, such as:\\n\\n\\n\\nLoss of health insurance:\\xa0When certain life changes cause you to lose insurance eligibility involuntarily, your situation might count as a QLE. Common examples of these types of QLEs include losing employer-sponsored coverage and aging out of a family plan.\\nPermanent move to/within California:\\xa0You qualify for enrollment when you move to California from another state. Some people who move from one part of California to another qualify when they have new Covered California plan options available to them at their new address.\\nNew child:\\xa0Having or adopting a child qualifies your entire family for special enrollment.\\nMarriage or domestic partnership:\\xa0When you get married or enter a domestic partnership, you and your partner may purchase a new health plan.\\nReturn from active-duty military service:\\xa0For 60 days after losing coverage from leaving active duty, reserve duty or the California National Guard, you qualify for special enrollment.\\nRelease from jail or prison:\\xa0You can purchase a health plan outside of open enrollment for 60 days after release from prison or jail.\\nNew citizenship or lawful presence:\\xa0You qualify for special enrollment if you become a permanent legal resident, citizen or national of the United States.\\nMembership of a federally recognized American Indian or Alaska Native tribe:\\xa0As an American Indian or Alaska Native who belongs to a federally recognized tribe, you can enroll at any time throughout the year and change health plans up to once a month.\\nOther QLEs/none of the above:\\xa0Many other situations that we list on our QLE page could qualify you for special enrollment. You can also apply for Medi-Cal or the Medi-Cal Access Program (MCAP) for pregnant women at any time if you don’t have a QLE.\\n\\n\\nOur Alternatives to Short-Term Health Plans\\nDuring the Covered California open enrollment period, We offer four tiers of insurance plans from the following providers:\\n\\nAnthem Blue Cross Covered California\\nBlue Shield Covered California\\nKaiser Permanente Covered California\\nMedi-Cal\\nOscar Health Plan of California\\nHealth Net Covered California\\nL.A.

In 2018, 93 percent of Californians have coverage, indicating greater health outcomes for the state’s residents overall. However, this number still leaves seven percent of Californians — around three million individuals — uninsured.\\nCalifornia’s remaining uninsured lack coverage for many reasons. Some are ineligible for coverage due to their immigration status. Others come from low-income households where insurance may not be a top priority.\\nSome individuals may actually qualify for financial assistance but remain uninsured because they either have trouble with the enrollment process or don’t know they qualify for aid. And in some cases, California’s high cost of living, especially with regards to housing, may make insurance premiums difficult to afford even with financial assistance.\\nDespite these barriers, low-income individuals can still find affordable insurance. California offers several health insurance options for people with low incomes. Indeed, these options are often more affordable than remaining uninsured long-term.\\n\\nWhy Health Insurance Is Important for People With Low Incomes\\n\\nThough paying for health insurance can be expensive, it generally saves people money in the long-term. By providing a safety net, health insurance helps everyone — especially low-income individuals — stay healthy without spending a fortune in the process. Here are a just a few reasons health insurance may benefit you and your family:\\n\\nInsurance makes preventative care more accessible: Preventative care services are the routine measures you take to maintain good health, such as getting a flu shot, visiting the dentist or getting a cancer screening. By reducing the cost of routine healthcare visits, insurance encourages preventative care, which can help you avoid more serious and expensive health conditions down the line.\\nInsurance helps you handle emergencies: Medical emergencies do happen, and they can be costly. Without insurance, even one emergency hospital visit can trap a family in medical debt that’s difficult to escape. Ongoing medical bills, such as for cancer treatment, might be even more difficult to manage alone. Though coverage may seem expensive, it usually costs less than handling an emergency uninsured.\\nThe law requires people to have health insurance: Under the ACA, people are required to have health insurance by law. If you don’t have insurance, you may face fines. Since affordable options exist, it’s better to get the coverage you need and avoid fines rather than pay penalties while also running the risk of paying for a medical emergency on your own.\\n\\nHealth insurance comes with many benefits. It can save you money and help keep you and your loved ones healthy. Furthermore, low-income individuals need the benefits of health insurance even more than those with higher incomes, since it allows them to get the care they may otherwise be unable to afford.\\nIn California, people with low incomes can benefit from a variety of affordable coverage options that make the advantages of health insurance available to almost everyone.\\n\\nAffordable Insurance Options for Low-Income Californians\\n\\nLow-income families and individuals in California have several options for finding affordable health insurance. The three biggest pathways to coverage are Medi-Cal, premium assistance and cost-sharing reductions.\\nEach program has slightly different features and eligibility requirements. But all three options make coverage more accessible to low-income Californians. The following sections will explain each program in more depth.\\n1. Coverage Through Medi-Cal\\nMedi-Cal is California’s Medicaid program, which provides inexpensive or free care services to more than 13 million Californians. Populations served by Medi-Cal include children and their families, senior citizens, people with disabilities, current and former foster care youth and some low-income adults, including those with diseases like breast cancer and HIV/AIDS, according to the California Department of Healthcare Services.\\nIn accordance with the ACA, Medi-Cal covers the required 10 essential health benefits:\\n\\nEmergency services\\nHospitalization\\nLaboratory services\\nMaternity and newborn care\\nMental health services\\nOccupational therapy\\nOutpatient services\\nPhysical therapy\\nPrescription drugs\\nSubstance use disorder services\\n\\nMedi-Cal also covers Medi-Cal also covers comprehensive dental care .\\nHow to Qualify for Medi-Cal\\nEligibility for Medi-Cal is determined by income level and household size as well as other factors. To qualify for coverage through Medi-Cal, a person must meet the following eligibility requirements:\\n\\nYou must be a California resident: You must live in California to qualify for Medi-Cal. Also note that children from low-income families may have access to Medi-Cal coverage regardless of citizenship status, as of 2016.\\nYou must belong to one of these served populations: You must be a low-income adult, child, senior citizen, pregnant woman, a person with a disability or former foster care youth 26 years of age or younger.\\nYou must meet income level requirements: Medi-Cal determines financial eligibility using Federal Poverty Level (FPL) guidelines as determined by the Department of Health and Human Services. To qualify for Medi-Cal, your household income must meet the percent FPL guidelines for your group and household size.\\n\\nWhen determining your family’s eligibility, remember that some groups maintain eligibility at higher FPL percentages. For example, children can qualify for Medi-Cal up to 266 percent of the FPL. Under the Medi-Cal Access Program (MCAP), pregnant women qualify between 213 and 322 percent FPL\\nFurthermore, even your family doesn’t qualify for Medi-Cal, children might qualify for programs like the County Children’s Health Insurance Program (CCHIP) if your household income falls between 266 and 322 percent FPL. This means that some family members may qualify for low-income insurance even if other family members do not\\nIf you or someone in your household qualifies for Medi-Cal, you can enroll right away, since there are no specific enrollment periods for Medicaid as there are for some other government health programs.\\n2. Premium Assistance Through Covered California\\nIn addition to Medi-Cal, other low-income insurance options exist. One of these options is premium assistance through California’s regular insurance marketplace, Covered California. Premium assistance is a tax credit available to consumers to help reduce the cost of monthly healthcare premiums.\\nHow to Qualify for Premium Assistance\\nTo qualify for premium assistance, you must meet the following requirements for income and healthcare options:\\n\\nYou must meet income level requirements: To qualify for this healthcare tax credit, your household income must fall between 138 and 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level.\\nYou must meet citizenship requirements: You must be either a U.S. citizen, U.S. national or a lawfully present immigrant to receive premium assistance.\\nYou must need insurance through the marketplace: You can only receive premium assistance if you do not have access to healthcare through an employer or other public health insurance programs like Medi-Cal.\\nYou must plan on filing taxes: Premium assistance is a tax credit, so to benefit, you need to plan on filing taxes for the year in which you enroll. However, you do not need to have filed taxes before enrollment to qualify.\\n\\nIf you know you don’t qualify for Medi-Cal and plan on getting insurance through the marketplace instead, it’s a good idea to check and see if you qualify for premium assistance, since it can lower your overall insurance costs.\\n3. Cost-Sharing Reductions Through Covered California\\nIn addition to premium assistance, cost-sharing reductions can make healthcare services even more affordable for low-income individuals. These subsidies reduce out-of-pocket costs for people enrolled in insurance through the marketplace.\\nCost-sharing reductions help reduce co-pays, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, making services more accessible with insurance, so this option may benefit people who tend to struggle with out-of-pocket charges.\\nHow to Qualify for Cost-Sharing Reductions\\nAs with Medi-Cal and premium assistance, cost-sharing reductions come with unique eligibility guidelines. To receive price reductions, you must meet the following requirements:\\n\\nYou must qualify for premium assistance: Premium assistance and cost-sharing reductions overlap. You must qualify for premium assistance to receive cost-sharing reductions, though you may qualify for premium assistance by itself as well.\\nYou must meet income requirements: You may qualify for cost-sharing reductions if your household income is 250 percent of the Federal Poverty Level or less.\\nYou must enroll in a Silver-level plan: Plans through Covered California receive Bronze, Silver, Gold or Platinum rankings based on coverage level. To receive cost-sharing reductions, you must enroll in a Silver-level plan. Reduced cost plans appear in the marketplace as “Enhanced Silver-Level” plans.\\n\\nIn addition to premium assistance, cost-sharing reductions help low-income individuals and families afford the on-the-spot costs associated with receiving healthcare services.\\n\\nAffordable Coverage Questions and Answers\\nMedi-Cal, premium assistance and cost-sharing reductions help make insurance available to many Californians with low incomes. However, every individual situation is unique — low-cost insurance options that work for some people may not work for others.\\nHealth for California Insurance Center exists to help you find health insurance that meets your individual needs. With this in mind, here are answers to a few additional questions about affordable coverage options available in California.\\n1. Are There Affordable Insurance Options for Non-Citizens?\\nAs a state with many immigrants, California works to promote the health of all its residents, not just U.S. citizens. Green card holders can apply for financial assistance and enroll in low-cost insurance plans through the Health for California marketplace as usual and may qualify for premium assistance or cost-sharing reductions.\\nUnfortunately, undocumented individuals won’t generally qualify for public insurance. However, they may find more affordable access to healthcare services through community health centers, county health programs and employer-based or student health plans.\\nEven if you don’t qualify for financial assistance, you may be able to receive care using programs in your community. Research options in your county and talk to a healthcare provider for more information.\\n2. What if My Application for Low-Income Insurance Is Denied?\\nSome applications for programs like Medi-Cal may be denied if the applicant doesn’t appear to meet the program’s requirements. If this happens, you can either search for other affordable options or challenge the decision.\\nIf you feel your request for affordable insurance was wrongfully denied, you may be able to challenge the decision by filing an appeal through the California Department of Social Services.\\nAfter a hearing, appeals can be granted or granted in part as well as denied, so filing an appeal may be worth a try if you’ve been denied assistance through an affordability program. You can check data on recent hearing results in California for more information about successful appeals.\\n3. What if I Need Help Finding or Enrolling in Insurance?\\nCalifornia’s public insurance marketplace, Covered California, can make the application and enrollment process complicated, which may prevent some individuals from getting the coverage they need.\\nFinding affordable health coverage should be as simple as possible. Health for California provides an easy and fast online application process to find insurance options and determine your eligibility for financial assistance. Our agents can help you navigate the process and find low-cost insurance options that work for you.\\nIf you’re interested in starting your insurance search, you can get a free quote through Health for California today.\\n\\nFind Health Insurance You Can Afford\\n\\nIf you live in California and lack access to the healthcare you need, look into the state’s affordable insurance options for low-income individuals and their families. Financial assistance programs make health insurance available to almost all Californians. Accessible insurance helps keep all individuals healthy regardless of their resources.\\nIf you’re looking for insurance options that fit your needs, check your eligibility for low-cost options by searching the Health for California website or speaking to an agent. Now that you’re aware of the options, you can find health insurance you can afford.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

That’s 4 out of 5 people! Vision insurance\\xa0helps you maintain eye wellness, aids with your overall health because eye exams evaluate for common health conditions, such as diabetes and high cholesterol, and it saves you money. Here’s an example of the savings:\\n\\nThe Cost\\nVSP\\xa0offers two vision plans, which cost $15.16 or $19.24 a month, per person.\\nEyeMed\\xa0offers three vision plans. The rates range from $5.50 to $31 a month, per person for a basic plan, or $16-$92.50 per month for a family of three or more on the richest plan. \\nRates are the same regardless of the person’s age or where in California they live. You can apply for a VSP plan or apply for an EyeMed plan.\\nBenefits\\nVision insurance helps pay for an annual eye exam and a pair of eyeglasses or contact lenses. And if you lose or break your glasses, or just want an extra pair, you can get additional glasses at a 20-40% discount, depending on which carrier you’re with. Also, members receive a discount of 5% to 15% for LASIK surgery. \\nSee below for a summary of benefits when services are received from a networked provider or facility. You’ll pay more for out-of-network services.\\n\\nFor details, click VSP Plan Details and EyeMed Plan Details.\\nExclusions\\nVision insurance does not cover eye surgery, treatments, or other types of eye care. Check your health plan for benefit information. If you enroll for vision insurance, you will be able to use the plan nationwide but not internationally. \\nEnrollment Eligibility\\nVision insurance is not subject to underwriting. It is available to adults age 18 and over, who are lawful residents of California, and have a Social Security number. \\nStand-alone vision insurance is not available to children-only. There is vision coverage for children enrolled on a health plan through Covered California. For children enrolled on a plan through Medi-Cal, please consult with Medi-Cal for available vision benefits. \\nA family vision plan may be purchased to include children. There would be no coordination of benefits between the health plan and vision plan for the children. The advantage of buying extra vision insurance for a child is that you can use one plan to pay for glasses and the other plan to pay for contact lenses, or an extra pair of glasses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Except in some states, guaranteed issue doesn’t limit how much you can be charged if you enroll.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Guaranteed Issue\\nIf you sign up for health insurance today, the insurance company can’t deny you for a pre-existing medical condition, but it’s not always been this way. Let’s take a look back for a minute. Laws have varied by state, but in most states an individual who had a pre-existing condition, or came down with a condition such as cancer could not get an individual or family health insurance plan.\\nSome insurance companies had a list of over 400 different medical conditions that could trigger a denial. People were turned away, or if they had a condition that was lower risk, some were offered coverage for a higher premium.\\nFor millions of Americans this was a major hardship. That all changed with the passing of the Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) on March 23, 2010. It became a federal law that health insurance policies must be sold on a guaranteed issue regardless of health status. This was an amazing step forward in moving the county toward a better system of healthcare, where all could be insured.\\nKey Dates\\n\\nMarch 23, 2010 – Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPCA) signed into law\\nSeptember 23, 2010 – All children under 19 could receive coverage guaranteed issue\\nJanuary 1, 2014 – All applicants for individual, family and group health plans are guaranteed issue\\n\\nExceptions\\nThere are a few health plans that are not required to follow the new rules of guaranteed issue.\\n\\nSupplemental insurance (some types). An example of this would be Short Term Insurance. Plans such as these do not have to meet the requirements for Obamacare California, so they are exempt from guaranteed issue.\\nGrandfathered Plans that were in existence before the new law was passed on March 23, 2010.\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

During the first year of Obamacare Open Enrollment, when many marketplace sites were having lots of trouble, the Covered California site functioned comparatively very well.\\nWhat if the website is slow?\\nThen, it’s probably a deadline! Actually, the Covered California website is rarely slow. Recently, site experienced a little lag around the December 15, 2015 deadline. It got hit harder around the January 31, 2016.

Those who stay on grandfathered plans may have the most affordable rates. All the extra taxes and fees associated with Healthcare Reform don’t apply to grandfathered plans. Also, the grandfathered plans are less regulated. Health insurance carriers are required to accept people with serious pre-existing conditions on individual and family plans that are not grandfathered, so the rates on these plans are expected to be higher than grandfathered plans. All that to say, if you are on a grandfathered plan, may make\\xa0the most sense for you to stay on your current health insurance plan.\\xa0Check your options to make sure this is going to be the best option for your money. Those that qualify for a subsidy through Covered California may want to compare premiums and benefits to see if a grandfathered plan or a plan with a subsidy makes the most financial sense for their situation.\\nSome Carriers Have Dropped\\xa0All Grandfathered Plans\\nBeware that some carriers have discontinued\\xa0their grandfathered plans. If your health insurance carrier has discontinued offering grandfathered plans, you\\xa0now have a plan that is compatible with the Healthcare Reform minimum essential benefits requirements. Premiums can be more expensive plan with better coverage.\\n\\nNot Grandfathered = Your Plans Were Automatically Switched\\nIn 2014, if your health insurance plan was\\xa0non-grandfathered, you were\\xa0automatically switched to a plan that complies with the Affordable Care Act mandate when your policy renewed in 2014. Generally, you were switched to a plan that was most comparable to the one you were leaving. Expect better benefits at higher costs.\\nOptions for Individuals and Families\\nUnless you are below 400% of the federal poverty level, individuals and families who have grandfathered plans will not want to switch. Rates on private health insurance rose dramatically in 2014 as tens of thousands of people with pre-existing health conditions entered the market. The only way people\\xa0could shield\\xa0themselves from these premium hikes was to stay on their grandfathered plan, switch to\\xa0California group health insurance\\xa0coverage or go uninsured.\\nOptions for Small Businesses\\nWhether you are grandfathered or not, you’ll want to get individual quotes and check on your options\\xa0during open enrollment each year. Small businesses will have four main options:\\n\\nStay on your grandfathered plan (if applicable)\\nGet standard coverage\\nGet coverage through Covered California for Small Business\\nDrop group coverage and enroll on an individual or family\\xa0plans\\n\\n\\nIf your small business is on a grandfathered plan, it will probably be the most affordable option. However, due to the fact that Rate Adjustment Factors (RAF)*\\xa0went away in 2014 (except on grandfathered plans), groups with high utilization may find it advantageous to switch to\\xa0an individual or family, or small business plan through Covered California even though they are currently on a grandfathered plan. All the\\xa0Covered California for Small Business Plans will be offered outside the exchange at the same rates. However, those enrolled in Covered California for Small Business within the state exchange will be able to offer multiple carriers to their employees while only getting one bill. Some small businesses who enroll through the exchange will qualify for government tax subsidies.\\nThere are some small businesses\\xa0entertaining the more radical idea of dropping group coverage\\xa0so employees\\xa0can enroll on individual/family plans. For businesses of\\xa049 or less full-time equivalent employees there is no mandate to offer health coverage and there is no penalty for not insuring your employees.\\xa0Employees with household salaries less than 400% of the federal poverty level\\xa0may qualify for tax subsidies from the federal government. Some of these employers may bump up wages a bit to make up for not offering healthcare. After crunching the numbers, employers may find that the business and the employees both save money by dropping group coverage and having their employees get individual coverage.\\nNote: Be sure to double check with your insurance carrier or\\xa0insurance agent to see if the plan you are currently enrolled under is in grandfathered status.\\n* Rate Adjustment Factors (RAF): An RAF is a modifier that insurers apply against group health insurance policies at renewal. It is based on the frequency and severity of the medical services received by the group members in the last year. It is also known as “experience rating”. If your employees and their covered dependents over-utilized the medical plan, the RAF will increase the premium. Conversely, if your group rarely used your benefits, the RAF would lower the premium. Groups with low RAF’s will find it more advantageous to stay on their grandfathered plans.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

But brushing and flossing alone is rarely enough. Regular dental visits support good oral care and dental insurance will help minimize the cost of needed services. Whether the dental coverage is to protect young children from tooth decay or older adults from chronic conditions, having a dental plan will minimize expenses.\\nNeeding dental or orthodontic work done can feel like a drag when you don’t have dental coverage. Below are some basics on dental plans that will help you find the right dental health insurance policy for you, your family, or your small business.\\nGet a Free Dental Quote\\nFinding Dental Insurance in California\\nHealth plans purchased through the Covered California Health Exchange automatically include pediatric dental benefits for children up to age 18. Many plans that are available off the Exchange also include pediatric dental insurance. Adults can get dental coverage in California by purchasing it as a supplement to their health insurance plan or on a stand-alone basis. Sometimes, stand-alone plans offer richer benefits. An exception is when the dental insurance is a supplement to a health plan that is purchased by an employer. Small business dental plans sometimes offer more benefits and orthodontia coverage may be less expensive to include. To find dental coverage, contact your Health Insurance Agent/Broker or your Human Resources Department, if your employer offers group health insurance.\\n\\nHere are some common terms used when talking about dental insurance. Becoming acquainted with them will help you in understanding California dental insurance policies and in choosing the one that is right for you.\\n\\nDeductible\\nA deductible is the amount that would be paid out of pocket before the dental coverage kicks in. For example, if the deductible on a dental insurance plan is $100, then the individual would have to pay the first $100 for services out of pocket before the insurance would cut down or discount any additional costs. Traditionally, a deductible usually does not apply to preventive services like routine dental cleaning and diagnostic X-rays. Some dental insurance plans do not have plan deductibles. When a deductible does not apply to a dental service, then, the patient pays a copay or coinsurance right away. Plans without deductibles tend to be more expensive.\\nCopayment / Coinsurance\\nAfter the patient satisfies the deductible, the insurance company will pay a portion of the bill. The patient’s portion of the bill is called the “copayment” when it’s a fixed dollar amount, or “coinsurance” when it’s a percentage of the bill. Depending on the level of dental coverage and the exact procedures being performed, the patient’s share of covered dental visit can range anywhere from 20% to 50% of the final bill.\\nYearly Maximum\\nAnother big term to consider is the “maximum” on each dental insurance policy. Generally, this is the most that the insurance company will pay in a calendar year. Maximums typically range anywhere from $750 to $2,000 per year. Usually, the more expensive the policy is, the higher the yearly maximum will be. Once a patient reaches the yearly maximum, the patient will be responsible for 100% of any remaining charges. Some of the richer plans do not have a yearly maximum.\\nConsider Waiting Periods\\nSome dental services may be subject to a waiting period. During the waiting period, dental coverage would not apply to selected major dental services. A typical waiting period can be 6 months for fillings or crowns, or up to two years for braces or wisdom tooth removal. Once the waiting period is over, dental insurance would apply.\\n\\nBasic Types of Dental Coverage Plans\\nThere are two basic types of dental coverage in California:\\n\\nDMO (Dental Maintenance Organization)\\nThis type of plan works similar to an HMO (Health Maintenance Organization) in that you would, mainly, receive services from a primary dental physician, who would coordinate your dental care and refer you to specialists in the network, as needed.\\nPPO (Preferred Provider Organization) or PDN (Participating Dental Network)\\nWith PPO or PDN plans, the patient chooses the dentist they want and the dental coverage follows them. As an option, patients in this type of plan may also see a networked dentist and pay lower fees for services.\\n\\nCalifornia Dental Insurance Plan Assistance\\nTo enjoy the benefits of both embedded and supplemental dental insurance for individuals in California, including free preventive and diagnostic dental care and prompt treatment for many dental conditions at low rates, you must get the best dental insurance California has to offer. We can help you purchase a family dental plan that provides adequate coverage for you and other members of the family.\\nWe also offer free guidance to help you choose the most suitable California individual dental insurance and family dental plans.

Today, WHA consists of the 6 medical groups below. With a wide range of doctors, clinics and hospitals and a commitment to not using narrow networks, WHA members can easily find high quality doctors who accept their coverage. These six medical groups represent 14 hospitals.\\n\\nOur agency has had many client complaints about doctors not accepting coverage by Health Net, Blue Shield of California and Anthem Blue Cross. There have been no complaints with Western Health Advantage. In addition, some clients do not like the limitations of being confined to Kaiser Permanente doctors and hospitals. For these clients, Western Health Advantage offers a perfect solution. WHA was formed by doctors and medical groups, and regularly attracts new physicians to join their network. The medical staff is happy with the health plan, and this satisfaction has a trickle down affect to members as well. WHA members are consistently happy with the customer service and the quality of care they receive. \\n\\n\\nHill Physicians Medical Group\\n800.445.5747\\nhillphysicians.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMercy Medical Group\\n916.733.3333\\nmymercymedicalgroup.org\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeritage Medical Network\\n415.884.1840\\nmeritagemed.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNorthBay Healthcare Center for Primary Care\\nVacaville: 707.624.7500\\nFairfield: 707.646.5500\\nGreen Valley: 707.646.3500\\nnorthbay.org \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUC Davis Medical Group\\n800.282.3284\\nucdmc.ucdavis.edu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWoodland Clinic Medical Group\\n530.668.2600\\nwoodlandhealthcare.org\\n\\n UC Davis Medical Center\\nMembers of Western Health Advantage also have access to the highly rated UC Davis Medical Center.

Some small businesses within the WHA service area had employees who were outside of the service area. Including a PPO health plan will allows these small businesses to offer WHA coverage to their employees and still be able to include coverage that will work for employees who live further away. So, when a small business owner says, “But I have an employee outside of your area”, Western Health Advantage now has a solution.\\nWestern Health Advantage also offers small group dental PPO plans. These PPO plans are underwritten and administered by Premier Access Insurance Co. They are available as a rider to sole carrier groups with 3 or more enrolled employees.”\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

They must have a household income that is less than or equal to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to qualify.\\nThe Debate: Should the Affordable Care Act Include Health Insurance for Illegal Immigrants?\\nIn 2010, when the Affordable Care Act (ACA) was front and center in the media, this was a hot button issue. Conservatives in California were concerned that they would end up footing the bill for health insurance for immigrants who were not lawfully present. However, the reality is that we only have two options:\\n\\nPay for health care for illegal immigrants.\\nRefuse to service illegal immigrants with health care needs.\\n\\n Most Californians can’t stomach the idea of leaving people outside the hospital to die, so option #2 isn’t really an option. Health care for immigrants must be provided, and someone has to pay for it.\\nPrivate Health Care Organizations Have Footed the Bill for Illegal Immigrant Medical Services\\nBefore Health Care Reform and up until recently, usually private hospitals got stuck with the bill. Uninsured immigrants would show up at their doorstep with medical needs, and these private health care organizations, had to service them even though they would get compensation neither from the client nor the government.\\nNo one thought that private hospitals should have to foot the bill for health care services rendered to uninsured illegal immigrants, but many didn’t want their tax dollars to pay for health care for those who are not lawfully present.\\nThe Government Should Pay for Health Care for Immigrants\\nThe reality is that any way we look at it, we need to provide some sort of health insurance for immigrants who are not lawfully present, and the government, not private health care organizations, should be the one paying for this. Toward this end, some limited medical coverage in California is now being offered to illegal immigrants through Medi-Cal.\\nHealth Insurance Options for Immigrants Who Are Not Legally Present\\nImmigrants who do not have lawful presence can enroll through the Covered California website to get access to restricted Medi-Cal coverage. Also, they have the option of buying private health insurance coverage. In some counties in California, health insurance for immigrants is offered through special government plans.\\nAccording to Covered California, illegal immigrants do not qualify to buy medical coverage through the California Health Insurance Exchange. However, Medi-Cal health insurance for immigrants may be purchased through Covered California even for individuals and families who are not lawfully present. \\nMedi-Cal benefits may be limited, especially for illegal adults. Health care for immigrants who are not lawfully present can also be purchased through private health insurance plans outside of Covered California. Also, some county agencies in California offer government health insurance for immigrants who are not lawfully present.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

The California State Exchange is going to great lengths to not have an embarrassing repeat of the Anthem debacle. However, Covered California enrollments did end up in the Anthem system, and likely much of that information was compromised.\\nHackers Send the Insurance Industry into a Panic\\nIn the early part of 2015, the world found out that Anthem Blue Cross got hacked. This large-scale hack exposed the Personal Identifiable Information (PII) and the Personal Health Insurance (PHI) of nearly 80 million consumers.\\nThis nightmare sent the whole insurance industry into internet protection hysteria. Security had already been a huge priority for the Covered California website. However, this event led California health insurance carriers, the California Department of Insurance and the California State Exchange to tighten up security.\\nCovered California Protective Measures\\nProtocols became more detailed. Existing regulations were reinforced and repeated. Programmers were called upon to tighten up procedures and re-check the security on the Covered California website and network servers.\\nAlso, the insurance industry put more pressure on agents, navigators and enrollment counselors to amp up safety precautions which included enforcing high standards on ultra-secure servers, paper record protection and secure emailing.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Continue reading for information on Medicare Plans, prescription drugs, penalties, and enrollment periods.\\nSign Up for a Webinar\\nSchedule a Consultation\\n\\nGetting on Medicare is like building a house. The foundation is Original Medicare Parts A and B. Then, you build the walls by choosing either Medicare Advantage Part C or a Supplemental Plan. Medications are like the roof; you add them on at the end. If you choose Part C, usually Part D Prescription drug coverage is included. If you choose a Supplemental Plan, then you’ll need to add Part D.\\n\\n1. The Foundation: Original Medicare Parts A and B\\n\\xa0On July 30, 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law Social Security Amendments called the Medicare and Medicaid Act. Since then, eligible seniors and disabled persons have been able to get Original Medicare Parts A and B. These are the foundation of Medicare health insurance coverage.\\nPart A is for hospitalization and covers the hospital room. Part B is for office visits. Part B also includes x-rays, emergency, ambulance, IV medications, labs, MRI’s, and EKG’s.\\n2. The Walls: Choose Either Medicare Advantage or Supplemental Plans\\nOnce you have elected Original Medicare through the Social Security Administration, then you will want to add Medicare Advantage or a Supplement Plan to have more robust coverage.\\nMedicare Advantage Part C is the least expensive. It includes Part A and B, and it usually also includes Part D Prescription Drug Coverage. Medicare Advantage is usually HMO coverage. Also, you are more limited in physician options and procedures. That’s why the monthly premiums tend to be lower on Medicare Advantage as opposed to the Supplemental Plans.\\nMedicare Supplemental Plans include Parts A, B, C, D, F, G, K, L, M, N. These plans offer additional coverage that may be added to Original Medicare. Plans F and G are the most popular, and they offer the richest benefits. There are no doctor networks, so you can go to any physicians who accept Medicare. Also, these plans tend to cover more expensive procedures and offer more high-end PPO coverage. They do not include prescription drugs, so if you enroll in a supplemental plan, then you will also want to add Part D drug coverage.\\n3. The Roof: Add Part D Prescription Drug Coverage\\nYou can add Part D Prescription Drug Coverage on top of a supplemental plan or on top of Medicare Advantage (if Part C does not include medications). You must have “creditable drug coverage” (at least as good as Medicare drug coverage) or be on a Part D plan in order to avoid the penalty for not having prescription drug coverage.\\nMost Part D Plans have a deductible and a 5 tier system. And, these plans have three phases of coverage: the advertised phase, the coverage gap (or doughnut hole), and the catastrophic coverage phase. However, these plans do not have an out-of-pocket maximum. They offer discounted coverage, but there is no limit to how much you might pay for prescriptions drugs. For this reason, some people elect to stay on their employer-sponsored coverage, which has an OOP Max that applies to medications.\\n\\nShould I stay on my employer coverage instead of Medicare?\\nYou may have the options to switch to Medicare, stay on your employer plan, or have double coverage. Depending on the number of employees at your work, Medicare may pay first or second. If you are taking expensive prescription drugs and are able to maintain employer-sponsored coverage, then it may be to your advantage to do so. The size of your employer group plan makes a difference:\\n\\nEmployer Groups of Less than 20 Employees:\\xa0You may continue on your employer-sponsored plan as secondary coverage. If you do, your Medicare coverage will pay first. If you choose not to enroll in Original Medicare Parts A and B, your employer-sponsored coverage may have additional limitations for members who are Medicare eligible and may stop covering certain health care benefits that you had been receiving before.\\nEmployer Groups of More than 20 Employees:\\xa0You may maintain your employer-sponsored coverage and not enroll in Medicare. Or, you may add Medicare as a secondary coverage. In this case, your employer-sponsored coverage would pay first.\\n\\n\\nHow do you enroll in Medicare?\\nFor Original Medicare Parts A and B, you would enroll through the Social Security Administration. For Medicare Advantage, Supplemental Plans, and the Part D Drug Coverage, click here to shop and compare plans. You can enroll through Medicare, a private insurance company, or through an agent\\nWhen can you enroll in Medicare?\\nYou can enroll in Medicare during your 7-month Initial Enrollment Period (IEP) or each year during the Annual Enrollment Period (AEP).\\n\\nInitial Enrollment Period (7 months): For seniors, this begins 3 months before your birthday month and continues to 3 months after your birthday month. For individuals with disabilities, this begins 3 months before your 25th month of receiving disability payments and continues to 3 months after.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

More often than not, they provide the “best bang for your buck.” The affordable monthly premiums, mid-size deductibles and discounted fees for commonly-needed medical services make Silver Plans an attractive option for those who are trying to balance cost with benefits. If you have not yet received a quote, click\\xa0Affordable Health Insurance for California.\\nIs The Silver Plan Right For Me?\\nThe Silver Plan is best-suited for:\\n\\n\\nAn individual or family who mainly goes in for doctor visits, lab work or x-rays, or who takes generic drugs.\\n\\nSomeone who is relatively health.\\nAn individual or family who wants reasonable copayments for common services.\\n\\nThe Silver Plan may not be the best fit for an individual or family in the following scenarios:\\n\\nThe Silver Plan rate is too expensive. If this is the case, consider enrolling on a \\xa0Bronze Plan.\\n\\nA hospital stay or another expensive procedure is already anticipated. Then, it may make more sense to enroll on a health plan that doesn’t have a deductible, like the Gold or Platinum Plans.\\n\\n\\n4 Types of Silver Plans\\nThere are four levels of Silver Plans: Silver 70, Silver 73, Silver 84, and Silver 94. The Silver 70 Plan covers standard benefits. The other silver plans are called “Enhanced Silver Plans”.\\xa0 They offer extra discounts so members pay even less for medical services. Not everyone qualifies for enhanced silver plans. Eligibility is based on income, age, family size, and zip code. Generally, adults with an income of just above 138% to 250% of the\\xa0Federal Poverty Level\\xa0may qualify for enhanced benefits.\\n\\nSilver 70 – check out this plan for additional details\\nSilver 73 – check out this plan for additional details\\nSilver 87 – check out this plan for additional details\\nSilver 94 – check out this plan for additional details\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nIf your income qualifies you for any of the Silver Enhanced Plans which are the Silver 73, Silver 87, and Silver 94 then look carefully at the plan benefits. You will notice lower deductibles and copayments which, oftentimes compared with the other metal plans, prove to be the best deal out there. And who doesn’t want to take advantage of a good deal?\\nIf you are considering a PPO Silver plan it is extremely important to note that when the doctor or other provider is not part of an insurance company’s network, the member’s cost for services will be higher.\\xa0 For additional information, please contact the carrier or\\xa0our insurance agency.\\n\\nBased on your income and household size, you may qualify for Cost Sharing Reduction, which means you may be able to get improved benefits on the Enhanced Silver Plan you qualify for with no additional cost.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

The Open Enrollment Period (OEP): November 1 through January 31Renewal Packets Arrive: October and NovemberThe Special Enrollment Period (SEP): February through OctoberMost enrollment occurs during the Open Enrollment Period. No Qualifying Life Events (QLE’s) are required at this time. For those renewing, OEP gives members the opportunity to change plans each year. You can cancel your plan at any time, but to change plans, that must be done during the Open Enrollment Period. Or, you can change plans during the Special Enrollment Period with a Qualifying Life Event.Normally, during the Special Enrollment Period you would need a QLE to enroll or change plans. Qualifying Life Events include losing coverage, losing a job, having a baby, moving to California, getting married or divorced, etc.).Due to President Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Covid-19 Pandemic, more opportunities for enrollment have opened up outside of OEP. Also, this legislation made greater discounts available.You can find the following types of plansIndividual and Family Healthcare Plans: Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, all non-grandfathered health plans must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. They must provide coverage for hospitalization, emergency, preventative care, and prescription drugs. These plans are ACA compliant. They offer high-quality, affordable coverage to everyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.  Short-Term Plans: Short-term health plans  are no longer legal in California (SB910). However, consumers may enroll in a traditional medical insurance plan for as little as 30 days. This can fill healthcare insurance gaps and protect consumers who are between jobs.  Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65. This medical coverage is also available to qualifying individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses or disabilities. Medicaid:  This is referred to as  Medi-Cal in California . This coverage is offered to individuals and families with a household income that is below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

These plans cover baby check-ups, \\n            school screenings, sports and some immunizations. The best part about purchasing these plans is that \\n            the kids tend to be will be protected and illness spotted quicker which means they will be a lot healthier, \\n            and save you a lot of money.\\n        \\n\\n            The two most popular insurance plans being offered by most carriers include:\\n        \\n\\n\\nHMO: In this plan, your child has to use the network to access covered services. Exceptions are made only for emergencies.\\n            \\n\\nEPO: In this plan, your child has to use the network to access covered services, but you don’t need a referral from your primary doctor to see a specialist. Exceptions are made only for emergencies.\\n            \\n\\nPPO: In this plan, services are cheaper when your child goes to a network doctor, but you have the freedom to get services from an out-of-network physician.\\n            \\n\\n\\nHMO plans may also require that you select a primary care physician for your child, and that physician has to refer \\n            you in the event you need to see a specialist. With an PPO and EPO, you are free to see doctors and specialists without \\n            a referral.

Medicare Advantage plans are mostly HMO options and usually offer the lowest pricing available.\\n\\nMedicare Advantage is referred to as Part C. These plans cover most of what is normally included in Part A (in-patient hospitalization) and Part B (out-patient doctor visits). Also, they often include Part D (prescription drugs).\\nOn the other hand, Supplemental Plans allow you to add additional coverage to Parts A and B. Supplemental Plans tend to have more doctors available and allow a wider variety of procedures, but they do also tend to have higher monthly premiums than the Advantage Plans.\\n\\nIs Medicare Advantage available in my area?\\nMedicare Advantage is not available in all areas. In some rural areas, there are few or no options. On the other hand, in urban areas like Los Angeles County there are 50 or more options. If you live in a more populated area, you will almost certainly have Medicare Advantage Part C options.\\nSign Up for a Webinar\\nSchedule a Consultation\\n\\nWhat is the Network like?\\nMedicare Advantage plans have a network of doctors to choose from. It may be an HMO, PPO, or POS network.\\xa0 Supplement plans, on the other hand, do not have a network.\\nPPO Advantage Plans may restrict members to receiving care only in their county. This can be an issue if you live close to the county line and wish to see doctors in a neighboring county.\\nWhat are the basic coverage benefits on a Medicare Advantage plan?\\nMedicare Advantage Plans include clinic benefits. Also, most of your inpatient hospitalization, home health care, skilled nursing facility and hospice that are normally covered by Part A will be covered by your Part C Advantage Plan. In addition, the Medicare Advantage health insurance benefits include:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreventive Care\\nDoctor/Specialist\\nUrgent Care\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLab Tests\\nImaging\\xa0\\nEmergency\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrescription Drugs\\nX-Rays\\xa0Doctor Visits\\nHospitalization\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nThese plans must include an out-of-pocket maximum. This is your worst-case scenario, or your total liability. If you received a $200,000 hospital bill, how much of that expense would you have to pay? Once you have reached the OOP Max, the health insurance carrier picks up the remainder of your qualified medical expenses for the rest of the calendar year. The OOP Max could be between $700 and $11,000. An average OOP Max would be around $3,000 – $4,000.\\xa0\\nBe aware!\\xa0\\n\\nMedication expenses do not add toward the maximum out of pocket and are not subject to it.\\nMedicare Advantage plans can restrict treatment options. For example, in one area of California, a consumer found that Proton Radiation Therapy for prostate cancer was not covered by any of the Medicare Advantage options. However, the consumer was able to get this treatment covered with a Supplement Plan.\\n\\nWhat ancillary benefits may be available through a Medicare Advantage plan?\\nMost Part C insurance plans include additional ancillary benefits above and beyond what Medicare covers:\\xa0\\n\\nAncillary benefits that may be included automatically: vision, gym memberships, chiropractic, acupuncture, free fit bit, therapeutic massage, OTC medications, discount towards weight loss programs, hearing aid coverage, travel assistance coverage, dental (usually an HMO dental plan with minimal coverage), membership to Brain HQ (mental acuity exercises/games which can help you avoid dementia and improve your memory, cognitive speed and clarity)\\nOptional ancillary benefits that you may be able to add at an additional cost: dental or vision upgrades\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

This could be a change to your family, your residence, your previous health coverage, and a number of other things. Without a life event you won’t be able to enroll in a new plan until the next open enrollment period.\\n\\nEach QLE carries some fairly strict guidelines in order for it to qualify you for a special enrollment period.\\xa0Click on one of the life events listed below for more info.\\nLost my health insurance including Medi-Cal\\nPermanently moved to/within California\\nHad a baby\\nAdopted a child\\nGot married\\nEntered into domestic partnership\\nReturned from active duty military service\\nReleased from incarceration\\nGained citizenship/lawful presence\\nAmerican Indian/Alaskan Native\\nOther qualifying life event\\nNone of the above\\nLost my health insurance including Medi-Cal\\nIf you’ve lost or will soon lose Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) health insurance, you may qualify for special enrollment. In order to qualify, you must not have lost your coverage voluntarily. That means, for example, you do not qualify if your coverage was cancelled because you weren’t able to pay for it. However, if you had employer-sponsored coverage and lost your job, you probably lost your coverage as well. In this case you would qualify and may enroll in a plan. Consumers (new and existing) who have an involuntary loss of MEC will have a unique 120 day special enrollment period in which they can apply – up to 60 days before and 60 days after the loss event date.\\nAnother common example is someone who loses their Medi-Cal coverage. Perhaps you’ve been on Medi-Cal for a while, and then you receive a raise on your job or start working more hours.

You would only have to decide which carrier you want, and whether you want an HMO, EPO, PPO or HSP.

The program is available for adults, children, pregnant women, older adults and people with disabilities. People who have certain conditions, such as tuberculosis and HIV, might also qualify for Medi-Cal.\\n\\nWho Is Eligible for Medicaid in California? \\nMedi-Cal is available to California residents who are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, legal aliens or U.S. nationals. There are several ways to qualify for the program. Some individuals qualify based on their household income level. Other nights qualify because they meet certain requirements concerning their health status or age.\\xa0You\\xa0are eligible to receive benefits if you are:\\n\\nOver the age of 65\\nBlind or disabled\\nPregnant\\nIn a nursing or intermediate care home\\nUnder the age of 21\\nA refugee living in the U.S. temporarily\\n\\nAs a parent or guardian relative of a child who is under the age of 21, you may be eligible for Medicaid assistance if you’re taking care of the child because the parents:\\n\\nHave died\\nDo not live with the child\\nAre incapacitated\\nAre not employed\\n\\nYou may also qualify for Medi-Cal benefits if you are already enrolled and receiving benefits from one or more of the following programs:\\n\\n\\n\\nCalFresh:\\xa0California’s food stamp program is called CalFresh. The federal version of the program is called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Eligibility for CalFresh is based on income level and your monthly expenses.\\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) and State Supplementary Payment (SSP):\\xa0The SSI program gives adults who meet certain requirements, such as being blind, over the age of 65 or disabled, supplement income monthly. SSP is California’s version of SSI.\\nCalWorks:\\xa0This program provides cash assistance to families that have children. Eligible families receive cash monthly to help them pay for food, housing and other needs. Eligiblity is based on income, age, resources and citizenship status.\\nRefugee Assistance:\\xa0California’s Refugee Assistance program is designed for refugees who don’t have children and who don’t have any other form of assistance. The program provides employment assistance to help people gain self-sufficiency.\\nFoster Care or Adoption Assistance Program:\\xa0The foster care and adoption assistance program in California is designed to help people adopt a child. The children who are eligible for the program would otherwise have remained in long-term foster care.\\n\\nIf you think you might be eligible for any of the above programs but haven’t yet applied or started receiving benefits, you can do so through\\xa0BenefitsCal.\\xa0Health for California can help you through the\\xa0Medi-Cal application process.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApply Now\\n\\n\\nMedicaid Income Eligibility Requirements\\nUsually, if you’re eligible for the programs above, you meet certain income requirements.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

No Qualifying Life Events (QLE’s) are required at this time. For those renewing, OEP gives members the opportunity to change plans each year. You can cancel your plan at any time, but to change plans, that must be done during the Open Enrollment Period.

Qualifying Life Events include losing coverage, losing a job, having a baby, moving to California, getting married or divorced, etc.).Due to President Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Covid-19 Pandemic, more opportunities for enrollment have opened up outside of OEP. Also, this legislation made greater discounts available.You can find the following types of plansIndividual and Family Healthcare Plans: Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, all non-grandfathered health plans must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. They must provide coverage for hospitalization, emergency, preventative care, and prescription drugs. These plans are ACA compliant. They offer high-quality, affordable coverage to everyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.  Short-Term Plans: Short-term health plans  are no longer legal in California (SB910). However, consumers may enroll in a traditional medical insurance plan for as little as 30 days. This can fill healthcare insurance gaps and protect consumers who are between jobs.  Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65. This medical coverage is also available to qualifying individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses or disabilities. Medicaid:  This is referred to as  Medi-Cal in California .

Comparing health plans and obtaining personal health insurance quotes and information has never been easy. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, you have consumer protection on your side. \\nBefore 2014, one could purchase an individual health insurance plan at any time of the year. But as of now, one can only buy individual health insurance during the open enrollment, except for special circumstances.s\\n\\nDo I Need Individual Health Insurance?\\nThe Obamacare mandate requires that most people obtain medical insurance coverage. If you are not already enrolled in a health plan that meets the Affordable Care Act minimum essential benefits requirements, you may need to switch plans. \\nThe mandate requires that most Americans and legal residents obtain health insurance that meets the standards set by the Covered California Exchange. Those who do not get covered for health insurance may face a penalty. \\n\\n\\nYou may also need to get Individual Health Insurance in California if: \\n\\n\\n\\nYou are self-employed. \\nYour employer does not offer group plans. \\nYou are enrolled in a group plan, but it does not cover your spouse or dependents.\\nYou are enrolled in a health plan, but the premiums are too high.\\nYou are enrolled in a health plan, but your benefit needs have changed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros and Cons of Individual Health Insurance\\nFor some, personal health insurance is the only way to meet ACA requirements, If you have the option of group health insurance, personal health insurance plans may still be the better option. It all comes down to which plan best meets your needs.\\nIndividual health insurance has several benefits, such as:\\n\\nMore control:\\xa0Individual plans allow you to choose\\xa0from a wider plan selection than just the ones your employer presents to you. You can find a more customized solution that includes what you need and excludes what you don’t.\\nFlexibility:\\xa0Personal health insurance is not tied to your employment. This can be useful if you are concerned about job loss or changing positions. You can even use it to “close a gap” between an insufficient employer-provided plan and your healthcare needs.\\nChoice of insurer:\\xa0You can choose from more insurers with an individual plan. Some will have certain benefits, customer service offerings or pricing models that are more appealing to you.\\n\\nOn the other hand, individual health insurance also has some downsides:\\n\\nHigher costs:\\xa0Often, a group plan is partially paid for by the employer and has lower premiums in the first place. Without these savings, individual plans can be slightly more expensive.\\nPre-existing condition coverage:\\xa0Individual plans may charge additional fees or lack coverage if you have a pre-existing condition.\\n\\nTypes of Individual Health Insurance \\nIndividual health plans vary in how they are structured and how much they pay for your health costs. Under the ACA, all health plans must meet certain minimum essential coverage, meaning that no one can be denied during the Open Enrollment Period for any pre-existing medical conditions.\\n\\nHealth plans are classified under five major categories to make comparing them easier. The categories are divided according to the percentage of health care costs they pay, and they include the following:\\n\\nPlatinum – Plan pays 90% of your health costs. You pay 10%. \\nGold – Plan pays 80% of your health costs. You pay 20%. \\nSilver – Plan pays 70% of your health costs. You pay 30%. \\nBronze – Plan pays 60% of your health costs. You pay 40%. \\nCatastrophic – These plans are only for people under 30 years or those experiencing financial hardship. These plans pay less than 60% of your health care costs.\\n\\nWith these categories, you’ll also find different structures:\\n\\nHealth maintenance organization (HMO):\\xa0HMOs provide low out-of-pocket costs with a limited choice of providers and out-of-network coverage only in emergencies. These plans revolve around seeing a primary care doctor who can make specialist referrals.\\nPreferred provider organization (PPO):\\xa0A PPO has higher out-of-pocket costs than an HMO, but with more flexibility. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist, and you have more provider options, including some coverage for out-of-network providers.\\nExclusive provider organization (EPO):\\xa0EPOs have lower premiums than PPOs and don’t require referrals, but provider choices are more limited. Seeing an out-of-network provider in a non-emergency setting will not be covered.\\nPoint-of-Service Plan (POS):\\xa0This kind of plan generally offers more choices of providers than an HMO but still requires referrals for specialists. Like a PPO, in-network care is less expensive than out-of-network care.\\n\\nChoosing the Plan That’s Right for You\\nChoosing a personal health insurance plan that best fits your needs depends on a few different factors. Consider the following aspects and determine how they’ll affect your plan:\\n\\xa0\\n\\nProvider eligibility and choice:\\xa0Want to keep your current doctor? Make sure they’re in-network first. Also, make sure you’re comfortable with the providers covered under the plan.\\nMedication eligibility:\\xa0Medication coverage can vary widely by form, brand and prior approval requirements. If you take regular medications, you’ll want to make sure they’re covered appropriately.\\nPremiums vs. out-of-pocket costs:\\xa0If you frequently visit the doctor, lower copayments can be easier to manage but will have higher premiums. Alternatively, if you rarely see a doctor, lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs might be a good choice.\\nNetwork resources:\\xa0If you don’t have much patience for phone calls, reimbursements and paperwork, you may want to look for a provider with particularly strong customer service or few requirements on your end.\\n\\n\\nBuying California Individual Health Insurance \\n\\nBefore purchasing personal health insurance, you need to think about your health care needs and budget. Then, compare various plans to find the most suitable fit. Here are some questions you need to consider.\\n\\nHow is the plan structured? \\nWhich providers are in the network? \\nWhat is covered by the plan?\\nHow much out-of-pocket costs do you pay? \\nHow much does the plan pay for your coverage? \\n\\nThink about your budget as well as your health care needs, and find out how much it will cost you in insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for every plan you consider. Covered California makes it easier to compare different plans and choose the one that fits your individual health needs and budget. \\nMaking a smart choice in health insurance isn’t easy, but the research you do now will pay off later when you need health care for yourself and your family.

From 2013 to 2014 the number of uninsured went from 15% to 10%. As of 2020, this number has dropped to 7% (Kaiser Family Foundation State Health Facts for California).There are still more people that need coverage. However, the California State Exchange is one of the most successful at implementing Obama Care (The Affordable Care Act) in the country.Is Health Insurance Coverage Required?The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010. This legislation, often referred to as Obamacare, required all U.S. citizens and permanent residents to have health insurance. Also, that coverage must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. President Trump and Congress overturned this mandate in 2018. However, California implemented their own mandate in 2019. Thus, everyone in the state must continue to be enrolled in a health plan throughout the year. If you go without health coverage, you will pay a tax penalty.When Can I Enroll?Health for California gives you quick and instant access to quotes.

The Open Enrollment Period (OEP): November 1 through January 31Renewal Packets Arrive: October and NovemberThe Special Enrollment Period (SEP): February through OctoberMost enrollment occurs during the Open Enrollment Period. No Qualifying Life Events (QLE’s) are required at this time. For those renewing, OEP gives members the opportunity to change plans each year. You can cancel your plan at any time, but to change plans, that must be done during the Open Enrollment Period. Or, you can change plans during the Special Enrollment Period with a Qualifying Life Event.Normally, during the Special Enrollment Period you would need a QLE to enroll or change plans. Qualifying Life Events include losing coverage, losing a job, having a baby, moving to California, getting married or divorced, etc.).Due to President Biden's American Rescue Plan and the Covid-19 Pandemic, more opportunities for enrollment have opened up outside of OEP. Also, this legislation made greater discounts available.You can find the following types of plansIndividual and Family Healthcare Plans: Since the passing of the Affordable Care Act, all non-grandfathered health plans must meet the minimum essential benefit requirements. They must provide coverage for hospitalization, emergency, preventative care, and prescription drugs. These plans are ACA compliant. They offer high-quality, affordable coverage to everyone, regardless of pre-existing medical conditions.  Short-Term Plans: Short-term health plans  are no longer legal in California (SB910). However, consumers may enroll in a traditional medical insurance plan for as little as 30 days. This can fill healthcare insurance gaps and protect consumers who are between jobs.  Short-term travel  insurance is still available. Medicare: Medicare and Senior Health Plans  are granted to qualifying individuals over the age of 65. This medical coverage is also available to qualifying individuals who suffer from chronic illnesses or disabilities. Medicaid:  This is referred to as  Medi-Cal in California . This coverage is offered to individuals and families with a household income that is below 138% of the Federal Poverty Level.

Don’t get the most extensive plan if you feel it would not serve you. However, make sure you have enough coverage for unexpected situations, like an accident or if you develop a new condition.\\nPremiums and out-of-pocket costs:\\xa0When you retire, your budget will be more important than ever. When exploring your options, you should also make sure that your desired plans fit into what you can afford to spend.\\nAccess to your preferred providers:\\xa0Medicare plans do not cover all providers.\\xa0If you have a physician or hospital from which you want to receive treatment, ensure they’re a part of the network you’re exploring.\\nSpeaking with trusted advisors:\\xa0Whether it’s your best friend, a family member or a plan representative, you may want to discuss your options with someone that fully understands your Medicare options and can give you advice from experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nEligibility and Requirements\\nGenerally, you’re eligible for Medicare when:\\n\\nYou’re 65 years old or older.\\nYou are not 65 but have a qualifying disability or End-Stage Renal disease.\\nYou or your spouse have worked for ten years for an employer covered by Medicare.\\nYou’re a citizen or permanent United States resident.\\n\\n\\nEnrollment\\nYou can begin the enrollment process for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday. You should make sure your enrollment is complete three months after your birthday at the latest. This time is your Initial Enrollment Period. You can enroll by\\xa0visiting the Social Security website\\xa0or\\xa0your local Social security office, or you can call them at 800-772-1213. When you enroll during this period, you can ensure you start getting your benefits as soon as you’re eligible for them and avoid paying penalty fees.\\nIf you miss applying during your Initial Enrollment Period, your next option is to sign up during the General Enrollment Period that happens every year between January 1 and March 31. You may also be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period\\xa0under certain circumstances.\\nIf you already receive Railroad Retirement or Social Security benefits and you’re turning 65, you might be automatically enrolled in the program. If so, you’ll get your Medicare card in the mail either three months before your 65th\\xa0birthday or once you’ve been on disability for 25 months.\\nStill Have Questions on Medicare Plans?\\nWe thought you would!

But is it secure? When you apply online, you are entering all the information a hacker would ever need to sign up for credit cards in your name. Individuals of dubious character could easily drive your credit into the dirt if they got a hold of your Personal Identifiable Information (PII). So before you enter your PII online, you need to know that the Covered California website is secure. So… Is it?\\nYes, it’s secure.\\nNot worry you more, but there’s more you need to know. When you submit your application to Covered California online, your PII is also transferred to the carrier you select and often to the Medi-Cal SAWS system. It’s a little scary with your personal data moving around that much.\\nInformation Protection Under the Affordable Care Act\\nWhen the Affordable Care Act was passed and states began creating online exchanges, security was a huge concern. Then, after the Anthem Blue Cross fiasco, online safety of information became of even greater concern. In short, the website and all the servers housing your personal information are secure and your information is encrypted in transit, so it stays secure as it transfers from your computer to the Covered California network servers, to the Medi-Cal SAWS System and to the health insurance carriers network systems.\\nHas the Covered California Website been hacked? No. And, after all the precautions that have been put in place due to government regulations and fears of repeating the Anthem Blue Cross debacle, it probably never will be broken into by hackers.\\n\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Covered California took this a step further and streamlined all the plans they offered on-exchange, so they became a real “apples to apples” comparison.\\n\\nThe silver tier is the most popular, so using it as an example, if you were looking at all the Silver 70 plans on the Covered California marketplace, there would be no plans benefit differences. You would only have to decide which carrier you want, and whether you want an HMO, EPO, PPO or HSP. These acronyms represent the type of network you would have access to and essentially which doctors, and hospitals accept your insurance.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $\\nPopularity: \\nDeductible: $6,300 Individual \\n$12,600 Family\\nDoctor Visits: 1st 3 Visits $65-$95\\nGeneric Drugs: Full price up to $500 per script after drug Ded\\nHospital: Full price up to OOP Max\\nOOP Max: $8,200 Individual \\n$16,400 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: \\n60%\\nYou Pay: 40%\\n\\n\\n\\nmore info\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $$ and less\\n Popularity: \\nDeductible: $5,400 Individual \\n $10,800 Family\\nDoctor Visits: $50 – $90\\nGeneric Drugs: $19\\nHospital: 20% after deductible up to OOP Max\\nOOP Max: $9,100 Individual \\n$18,200 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: 70%\\nYou Pay: 30%\\n\\n\\n\\nmore info\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $$$\\n Popularity: \\nDeductible: None\\nDoctor Visits: $35 – $65\\nGeneric Drugs: $15\\nHospital: $600 per day up to 5 days (most HMO’s)\\n 20% (PPO, some HMO’s)\\nOOP Max: $8,700 Individual \\n$17,400 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: 80%\\nYou Pay: 20%\\n\\n\\n\\nmore info\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $$$$\\nPopularity: \\nDeductible: None\\nDoctor Visits: $15\\nRx: $30\\nHospital: $250 per day up to 5 days (HMO)\\n 10% (PPO)\\nOOP Max: $4,500 Individual \\n $9,000 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: 90%\\nYou Pay: 10%\\n\\n\\n\\nmore info\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nThe metal plans categories help identify how much you would pay of estimated average medical costs, compared to how much the insurance company pays.

These plans provide extra medical coverage and can also be used to contribute to other costs not covered by your primary insurance plan such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.\\n\\n\\n\\nDental\\nTravel Insurance\\nVision\\nMedicare Supplement Plans\\n\\n\\n\\nMost people with insurance from their employers may not be familiar with supplemental health insurance plans because they’ve never thought they needed them. That is until they receive medical bills from their primary doctor’s offices only to see a recent service that was not covered by their original plan.\\nOr maybe they bought individual insurance plans and had to sacrifice coverage in certain areas to gain more protection in other areas. And again, there are so many things that are not adequately covered by most health insurance plans.\\nWell, the good news is that supplemental health insurance helps you handle any medical costs and out-of-pocket expenses that come your way.\\nHow Do Supplemental Health Insurance Plans Work?\\nSupplemental health insurance plans pay benefits to you. The amount you receive and how frequent it is paid out depends on the insurance coverage you have. Some common supplemental health plans provide specific disease coverage such as for cancer, Medigap, dismemberment insurance, accidental death, and hospital indemnity insurance.\\nWho Needs Supplemental Health Insurance?\\nNot everyone needs supplemental health coverage. While most of these plans are cheap, you certainly don’t need twofold coverage. Check out your basic health insurance policy to see if there any gaps in coverage. You don’t need supplemental health insurance unless you will potentially suffer the risk of financial strain from medical services not covered by your basic plan. On the other hand, if you have a risky job or a family history of serious illness that could cost you a lot, supplemental insurance can give you peace of mind for future uncertainties.\\nHere Are Some Examples of Supplemental Health Insurance Plans\\nThere are many different types of supplemental health plans in California, most of which are specific to a particular area of coverage. Often, these plans are purchased on their own, which means you don’t need to be on any other medical plan to buy them.\\n\\nMedicare Supplemental Plans: For seniors ages 65+ and qualified disabled individuals, after getting Medicare Parts A and B, they can add to their coverage by purchasing Medicare Advantage or a senior supplemental plan. Medicare Advantage tends to be more affordable, and the supplemental plans tend to offer more benefits and bigger doctor networks. Medicare Advantage usually includes prescription drugs, but supplemental plans do not. If you end up going with supplemental Medicare benefits, you’ll also want to add Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Coverage.\\nDental Health Insurance: Basic health insurance plans cover dental benefits up to 18 years of age. If you are over 18 years of age, you would need to buy stand-alone dental health insurance coverage from an insurance company.\\nShort Term Health Insurance: This is a viable insurance plan for people who need coverage for less than six months. For instance, it would be perfect for individuals who are in-between insurance plans or for those who cannot afford regular insurance but would like to have short-term coverage.\\nTravel Health Insurance: This is a great plan for anyone traveling out of the United States to another country. It covers illnesses or accidents that happen while you were traveling. The plan period is valid from when you leave your country until you arrive at your destination.\\n\\nFinding the Right Supplemental Health Insurance Plan\\nIt can be difficult to find the right supplemental health coverage even when you know what your budget and needs are. Common sense will go a long way in helping you find the best policy. Our online services will provide you with free, instant quotes for supplemental health insurance plans from the top insurance companies in California.\\nJust take a few seconds to complete our confidential form.

The Platinum plan offers a much smaller out of pocket expense when it comes time for doctor’s visits, labs, prescriptions, etc. in exchange for a higher premium per month. This plan features an attractive $0 deductible with minimal copays of $15-$30 for common services.\\xa0 And to top it off, if the worst should happen, the most you would have to pay in a year for covered services would be $4,500 for an individual or $9,000 for a family. This is the best of any plan offered on the Covered California Exchange. The only exception to this would be if you qualify for the\\xa0Silver 87 or Silver 94 plans.\\nIs the Platinum Plan Right for Me?\\nIt may be the perfect for you:\\n\\n\\nIf you want benefits similar to what you had through an employer. Oftentimes, the Platinum is the closest. To compare your previous plan to this one, feel free to contact\\xa0our agency so we can compare apples to apples for you.\\n\\n\\nYou don’t want a deductible, and you want the lowest out-of-pocket maximum in the event of a worst case scenario.\\n\\nYou have health needs that require a lot of services.\\n\\nThis plan may also be a good fit if you have a planned event, such as having a baby or if you know you will need a particular surgery or procedure that will be expensive. Once you utilize the plan for your coverage needs, you can always switch to another level of coverage if desired, during the next year’s open enrollment. The open enrollment typically takes place at the end of the calendar year and lasts 1-2 months. So keep this in mind as you plan.\\n\\n\\nFor other people it is enough that the Platinum level of coverage offers peace of mind that you just can’t put a price tag on. \\n\\n\\nIn comparing other metal plans ask yourself, “Does the premium justify the amount of times I would use the coverage?”\\xa0 If not, it may be to your interest to take a little more risk, pay less for either a\\xa0Silver or Gold plan,\\xa0and put the premium savings to use by saving it for unexpected events that may require a little extra money up front.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $$$$\\nPopularity: \\nDeductible: None\\nDoctor Visits: $15\\nRx: $30\\nHospital: $250 per day up to 5 days (HMO)\\n 10% (PPO)\\nOOP Max: $4,500 Individual \\n $9,000 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: 90%\\nYou Pay: 10%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Little More To Think About\\nWe have quite a few people that are concerned with good emergency room coverage that doesn’t break the bank.For many people this is what they are looking for.\\nIf you are considering a PPO Platinum plan, be aware that if you receive care “Out of Network” you may have a deductible (some carriers) to reach along with higher out of pocket costs than what you see on the standard benefits. For example on the standard benefits you would pay $ 40 to see a specialist. If you were to see a specialist “Out of Network” you may pay a deductible (some carriers) and then 50% of the cost. Check your plan benefit details for more information so you aren’t caught by surprise.\\xa0 For additional information, contact the carrier or\\xa0Health For California Insurance Center.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Their coverage area included the southwest region of Los Angeles County (pricing region 16) and Orange County (pricing region 18).\\nFor 2018 Oscar will be moving into Northeast Los Angeles which is Region 15.\\nGET A QUOTE FOR OSCAR\\nTake Note\\nBecause Oscar is new to the California market, we will need to see how they rated in New York. The New York Department of Financial Services gave them a quality ranking of second out of 12 New York PPOs and EPOs.\\nNetwork\\nA hybrid of the HMO and PPO model, Oscar will be offering EPOs. EPOs work similar to an HMO in that they only cover in-network services. But unlike an HMO, they do not require members to obtain a referral before visiting a specialist.\\nOscar’s Southern California network will include Providence Health & Services, UCLA Health and St. Joseph Hoag Health. This will give members access to 16 hospitals along with more than 5,000 doctors in the area.\\nIn Northern California Oscar’s network will offer UCSF Health, Sequoia Quality Care Network (and Sequoia Hospital), Hill Physicians, Verity Health System and SCCIPA.\\nTo view Oscar’s network of provider’s please click here.\\nThe Future is Here\\nOscar Health Insurance is proud to ride the wave of the future to not only offer members a mobile app that is intuitive, but user friendly. Many have said that what sets the Oscar model apart from others is the seamless experience. At any time a member can use the app to list a condition, and then are offered a free phone call from a doctor or a visit with a primary care doctor or a specialist with an estimated price. Oscar has said that in other states approximately 45% of their members use this web based app.\\nThe app also helps members see their plan information, the costs they have spent to date, and how that relates to their deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. A provider directory is accessible that can filter provider results based on language, years of experience, hospital admitting privileges, and distance, etc.\\nAn online health risk assessment is available for members to complete that gives them personalized results and a preventative health care checklist. They can also access personal health records that allow them to see a searchable timeline of past health care services received.\\nWhile Oscar may be strong in technology they take pride in providing a measureable human touch. There whenever members need them, live Oscar representatives answer 90% of all calls within 30 seconds.\\nGET A QUOTE FOR OSCAR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Typical services will range from a $30-$65 copay.\\xa0 Should\\xa0you ever need to visit the hospital or have a lot of medical needs, the most you would need to pay for covered services in a year would be $7,800 per individual or $15,600 for a family.\\nIs the Covered California Gold Plan Right for Me?\\n\\n\\nIf you don’t like deductibles, then let’s talk more. Not everyone has extra savings lying around to cover a deductible, but would rather pay a little more per month for a plan with copayments they can afford. If you are the kind of person who doesn’t want a plan with a deductible, i.e. the Minimum Coverage, Bronze or Silver plan, and you don’t like the price tag of the more expensive Platinum plan, then the Gold may be just right for you.\\n\\n\\nYou need specific medical services. Advanced lab work such as an MRI, CT, or PET can be pricey on a plan with a deductible. If you anticipate the need for these services, have a scheduled surgery, or are at high risk for occasional \\xa0hospital visits then this plan should be up for serious consideration.\\n\\n\\nIf you only frequent the doctor’s office, typically take generic drugs, and are not exposed to risk that takes you to the hospital often, then you may want to look closer at the\\xa0Silver Plan\\xa0to see which plan is going to be to your advantage.\\xa0 Remember, if you can pay the deductible on the Silver plan if needed, then the savings in premium per month is extra money in your pocket.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrice: $$$\\n Popularity: \\nDeductible: None\\nDoctor Visits: $35 – $65\\nGeneric Drugs: $15\\nHospital: $600 per day up to 5 days (most HMO’s)\\n 20% (PPO, some HMO’s)\\nOOP Max: $8,700 Individual \\n$17,400 Family\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\nInsurance Company pays: 80%\\nYou Pay: 20%\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nLet’s talk about PPO’s and how this would affect a Gold plan.\\xa0 If you enrolled on a Gold PPO plan, then the benefits described with affiliated copayments only apply when your doctor or medical provider is “In Network” or a “Participating Providers.”\\xa0 If you were to visit a “Non-Participating Provider” a deductible may be required (some carriers) plus your cost for the services may be higher, oftentimes approximately 20%- 50% (see plan coverage benefit details). In addition, you would have a much higher out-of-pocket maximum, in the event of a “worst case scenario”.\\xa0 So it is extremely important that you are aware of who is a “Participating Provider” and who is not before receiving your services. If your reason for enrolling in the PPO is to have access to that “Non-Participating” Provider who is an expert in their field, then just make sure you are aware of your portion of the cost so you are not caught by surprise.

This requirement would apply to all new plans as of January 1, 2014, both on and off the exchange.\\nEssential health benefits include:\\n\\n\\nAmbulatory patient services: This common form of health care includes all outpatient services that you receive without admission to a hospital, such as walking into your GP’s office for a checkup. Almost all carriers provide this coverage, but details vary from plan to plan.\\n\\n\\nEmergency services: When you go to the emergency room for urgent situations or conditions, this service is provided under most health plans. Plus, you cannot be charged extra for an out-of-network visit.\\n\\n\\nHospitalization: Your insurance must cover hospitalization, which includes inpatient care such as surgery and overnight stays in the hospital. Unfortunately, even with coverage, hospital bills can soar depending on how long someone requires these services.\\n\\n\\nMaternity and newborn care: Insurance must provide health coverage both before and after birth. This coverage means that prenatal care is considered a preventative service, which is provided at no additional cost. Plus, insurance will cover childbirth and infant care as well.\\n\\n\\nMental health and substance use disorder services: Although in some states coverage is limited, the ACA requires health insurance to cover mental health services, including behavioral health treatment. Some insurance gives patients a set number of therapy sessions per year.\\n\\n\\nPrescription drugs: All plans must cover at least one drug from every category listed in the U.S. Pharmacopeia. Although in some instances, an out-of-pocket cap must be met initially.\\n\\n\\nRehabilitative and habilitative services and devices: Many plans cover services that assist you in gaining or recovering mental and physical skills after an injury, a disability or a chronic condition. This coverage also encompasses the use of medical equipment such as wheelchairs, braces and walkers.\\n\\n\\nLaboratory services: This coverage differs depending on the type of service provided. Some screenings, like Pap smears or prostate exams, are covered as preventative. However, you may be billed for diagnostic tests ordered by your doctor to determine if you have a disease.\\n\\n\\nPreventive and wellness services and chronic disease management: The idea behind this benefit is to get individuals to see their doctor before they get sick and medical bills start to rise.

Many are concerned that giving those without lawful presence medical insurance will attract more illegal immigration. However, if these individuals do not have insurance, then what do we do when they have a health care need?\\nDo we leave illegal immigrants outside the hospital to die like they do with the uninsured in China? Or, do we offer them care? If we offer health care services to illegals, then who pays for this care? Should the private hospital have to foot the bill? Or, should the government pick up the tab?\\nWhat about health insurance for the children of illegal immigrants?\\nThen, the question becomes what about child only health insurance in California for illegal immigrants? What about children who do not have lawful presence ? If Californians couldn’t stomach adults without lawful presence not receiving care, then they definitely would not want to withhold health care from children.\\nMinors without lawful presence have several options regarding health insurance for children in California. If these kids are in a household that has an FPL of 266% or less, they qualify for full Medi-Cal. If the FPL is over 266%, the children may qualify for Restricted Medi-Cal, private health insurance or in some counties they may be offered other government health insurance plans.\\nChild Health Care Options Through and Outside of the California Health Exchange\\nAccording to Covered California, individuals and families who are not legally in California may enroll through the\\xa0 Covered California website to see if they qualify for family plans or child only health insurance coverage through Medi-Cal. However, the health care insurance benefits may be limited, especially for adults. Illegal immigrants can also purchase private insurance coverage on their own outside of the California Health Exchange. Also, there are some counties that provide special health insurance for the children of immigrants who are not lawfully present in California.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

It is a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) whose purpose is to keep people healthier by removing cost barriers for preventive care services and to lower health care costs overall. \\nBecause of Obama Care in California, preventive care is now free on most plans.\\xa0 This means these specific services are not subject to the deductible and you do not have to pay a co-pay or any co-insurance. This is true of all private non-grandfathered health plans that became effective September23, 2010 or after. In addition, there are specific free preventive services for women on plans that became effective August1, 2012 or after. \\nPreventive Care Services\\n\\nFor all adults\\n\\nBlood pressure screening\\n\\n\\nCertain immunizations\\n\\n\\nCholesterol screening for adults of certain ages or at higher risk\\n\\n\\nColorectal cancer screening for adults over 50\\n\\n\\nDiabetes (Type 2) screening for adults with high blood pressure\\n\\n\\nOther services for adults\\n\\nFor women\\n\\xa0\\n\\nBreast cancer mammography screenings every 1- 2 years for women over 40\\n\\n\\nCervical cancer screening for sexually active women\\n\\n\\nContraception and contraceptive devices\\n\\n\\nOsteoporosis screening for women over age 60 depending on risk factors\\n\\n\\nWell-woman visits to get recommended services for women under 65 including preconception care, prenatal care and breastfeeding support and equipment\\n\\n\\nOther services for women\\n\\nFor children\\n\\nBehavioral assessments for certain age ranges through age 17\\n\\n\\nCertain immunizations\\n\\n\\nHearing screening for all newborns\\n\\n\\nHeight, weight and body mass index (BMI) measurements for certain age ranges through age 1\\n\\n\\nOral health risk assessments for children of certain age ranges through age 10\\n\\n\\nVision screening for all children\\n\\n\\nOther services for children\\n\\nWhen Preventive Care Services Are Not Free\\nPreventative services are not free if obtained through an out-of-network provider. If the primary reason of your office visit is for diagnostic care, then you most likely will have to pay. This means that if the majority of your visit addresses health problems you are already having, then your visit is not a preventive care visit. It can also depend on how your doctor’s office codes the visit. If the preventive service is billed separately from the office visit, the preventive service must be free, but the office visit may have a cost. If you receive treatment given as a result of a preventive service visit but the actual treatment itself is not considered a preventive service, then you may have to pay.\\nHow to Make Sure Your Preventive Care Services are Free\\n\\n\\nMake sure you visit in-network doctors and providers\\n\\n\\nWhen scheduling your appointment, make sure to say it’s for your free annual preventative care exam \\n\\n\\nAt the appointment, ask your doctor to code your service as a preventive care visit\\n\\n\\nIf you need a more costly service such as a colonoscopy, ask a number of providers how the service will be billed before you make your appointment, and work with your insurance company to find out how to obtain most if not all of the service for free\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClose\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.

Your deductible will typically be the most expensive cost, so it’s important to understand the difference between a low deductible health plan\\xa0(LDHP)\\xa0and a high deductible health plan\\xa0(HDHP). The deductible that’s right for you will primarily depend on your health and financial situation.Your health insurance deductible is the money you\\xa0must\\xa0pay for medical services before your insurance\\xa0provider steps in. For example, if you have a $1,000 deductible, you will pay the first $1,000 of your medical bills out of pocket. After you pay the deductible, you will only have to pay a copayment fee on covered services while the insurance company covers the remaining amount.Before choosing a health insurance plan, you\\xa0must know all\\xa0the potential costs\\xa0involved.\\xa0Discover what common\\xa0health insurance terms mean\\xa0below so you can make a more informed decision:High deductible plans require\\xa0yo...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: April 10th, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              What Does Vision Insurance Cover?\\n                          \\n\\n\\n\\nVision insurance is a\\xa0plan that covers specialized eye care, such as routine eye exams and prescriptions for correcting vision errors, subject to exceptions. It’s separate from your medical or health insurance, covering eye care expenses instead of general eye complications considered as medical issues. The specific coverage under vision insurance varies depending on the insurance provider and the terms of the insurance contract or policy. However, there are some standard inclusions. It’s important to review your plan to determine what it covers and the level of coverage it provides.This guide discusses the standard vision insurance inclusion and exclusions. It also addresses the coverage you need if your vision insurance does not cover a condition or treatment.Vision insurance coverage depends on the insurer and the plan you purchase. However, standard coverage includes:You may get contact coverage on your medical or health insurance plan as an extra package.

These responsibilities can require a lot of mental and physical energy, necessitating occasional breaks to focus on self-care, relieve stress and ensure you are fully present when you return.When you step away, the person who relies on you needs uninterrupted support from knowledgeable and caring people. If your loved one is a Medicare recipient, respite care coverage can fill the gap. Let’s explore the terms and benefits of respite care and the associated payments.Respite care is a period that allows a primary caregiver a hiatus from looking after a patient or older loved one. Depending on your health care provider, this interval may last one afternoon or several weeks. Various people can provide respite services, including relatives, friends, professional caregivers, nurses and community volunteers.The patient will typically spend this time in a hospital or similar facility that...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: April 3rd, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              What Is Preventive Care?\\n                          \\n\\n\\nMost medical plans cover preventive services that come at no cost to the patient. But what is preventive care? What are the specific preventive care services for women, men and children?To answer your questions, we’ve compiled some preventive care guidelines so you can know what plans may be available to you, the services you may want to include in your care plan and what costs you may face.According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC),\\xa0seven out of every 10 deaths\\xa0among Americans every year are due to chronic diseases, of which many are preventable. By using preventive care, Americans can stop these illnesses before they become major health problems.Preventive care refers to services intended to prevent illnesses before you feel sick or become aware of any symptoms. The purpose of preventive care is\\xa0to shift\\xa0the focus from treating illnesses to maintaining good health and wellness.Preventive care can help\\xa0you stay healthy for longer\\xa0by preventing or delaying the onset of...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: April 1st, 2024\\n\\n                                                        under\\n                                                                Covered California Insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Telemedicine Guidelines in California\\n                          \\n\\n\\nInnovations in technology have changed the health care landscape, and telehealth services are an increasingly popular option for patient convenience and comfort. In California,\\xa0nearly 47% of adults reported using telehealth services\\xa0to seek care in 2022.California law has recognized telehealth as a legitimate form of health care delivery since 1996. Let’s explore the state laws and standards surrounding telemedicine.In short, yes — California allows telemedicine. State law recognizes telehealth as a mode for delivering health care services via technology to facilitate the consultation, diagnosis, treatment and management of a patient’s health and wellness.The two most common modes of telehealth services within California are:California physicians and health care providers are permitted to use telehealth technologies to provide care to patients located in the state. In most instances, they must be licensed by the Medical Board of California.Beyond that requirement, California’...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: March 27th, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              When Should Telehealth Be Used?\\n                          \\n\\n\\nNot every health issue requires a trip to your doctor’s office. Instead, many health concerns can now be addressed from the comfort of your own home.Telehealth use has risen dramatically\\xa0in recent years. Remote services do have limitations, so it’s important to know when to use telehealth appointments and when to see your primary care physician in person.Telehealth appointments use technology to connect patients with health care professionals remotely. Using your computer or smartphone, you can see your primary care physician for medical advice, diagnoses and even treatment without having to venture out.Your doctor should give you tips on\\xa0preparing for your telehealth appointment. A few common types of telehealth appointments include:Telehealth can also take the form of secure messaging through an online patient portal.For many people, telemedicine is a safer and more convenient alternative to in-person medical visits.

Learn how to maximize your plan’s benefits, whether you have VSP, EyeMed or another type of vision coverage.The first step to using your benefits is\\xa0understanding what your plan covers. That way, you can determine how eye care fits your budget and how often you can use your insurance. For example, you can use your VSP benefits once a year if you want coverage for an exam.It’s best to check your member benefits to see what your specific plan will cover in a year.What is your reason for needing an eye appointment? If you’re ready to use VSP benefits to order contacts or get new glasses, your vision insurance will come in handy. Vision insurance typically offers allowances to help cover the cost of these helpful products.However, if you’re concerned about a medical issue with your eyes, you may need to visit your primary care doctor. This doctor can diagnose problems like...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: March 13th, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Dental Savings Plans vs. Dental Insurance\\n                          \\n\\n\\nIf you are looking into dental health care coverage options, the two you have probably run across are savings plans and insurance. Both of these options can help you save after a trip to the dentist — it’s only a matter of which one is right for your needs.Dental savings plans are membership programs with discounts on dental care from participating dentists. These are ideal if you know you need extensive dental work done, as they can save you more than their membership fees each year.Here’s how they work:Traditional dental insurance plans are when an insurance company pays for your dental services in full or partial amounts. The exact plan you choose will determine\\xa0what services or procedures\\xa0they will cover — however, most insurance plans will take care of preventive care cleanings or exams.As the insurance holder, you will have to pay a monthly fee to stay enrolled. Most insurance plans also come with a deductible or copay. A deductible is a fixed amount you need to reach o...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: March 6th, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              Can Health Insurance Drop You?\\n                          \\n\\n\\nIn short, yes — health insurance providers have the ability to terminate your coverage. Whether the issue is on the provider’s or holder’s end, there must be a reason for the cancellation. Otherwise, it is considered frivolous, and there are laws in place to protect holders from those actions.Your health insurance can be terminated for several reasons. Whatever the cause, most reasons can fall under either voluntary or involuntary terminations.Voluntary terminations are those from the holder’s end of the equation, like when a policy holder decides to stop making payments during or after the end of a contract.Involuntary terminations are those where the health insurance provider decides to drop your plan. This can happen on the anniversary date or in the midterm. Midterm cancellations are coverage cancellations done any time before your policy’s contract renewal period. These are possible if you are found to have:In any termination situation, your provider must notify you\\xa0at...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: February 28th, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                              How to Use Your Health Care Benefits When You’re Healthy\\n                          \\n\\n\\n\\nAs a generally healthy individual, you may see health insurance as a “just-in-case” form of protection in the event you get injured or become sick. While your plan can provide that coverage in your time of need, you should know that your health care benefits likely go much further than helping with emergency room visits and primary care checkups — and you can use them even when you don’t necessarily need them.Ultimately, your health insurance is important and can be a major resource for keeping you mentally and physically fit. To get the most out of your plan and fully justify your monthly premium, you should know the ways you can use your benefits when you’re healthy.Every health care plan comes with basic components that make up how much and what the insurance covers. As you consider how to use your benefits throughout the year, you should understand each part of your plan to know exactly what you can and can’t do.While\\xa0different kinds of health insurance exist, the gen...\\n\\n\\n\\n                              (more...)\\n                          \\n\\n\\nPosted: February 21st, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategories\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCovered California Insurance\\n\\n\\nAgents and Brokers\\n\\n\\nApply with Covered California\\n\\n\\nHealth Insurance Quotes\\n\\n\\nIndividual Health Insurance\\n\\n\\nOscar Insurance\\n\\n\\nSmall Business Health Insurance\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Health Care\\n\\n\\nCalifornia Marketplace\\n\\n\\nObamacare Website for California\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOlder Posts\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nObama Care\\n\\n\\n\\n              Not sure how Obamacare affects your health care plans in California?\\n              Learn how the ACA works in California, including benefits, costs and\\n              enrollment.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCA Health Exchange\\n\\n\\n\\n              Covered California is the Golden State’s official health exchange\\n              marketplace where individuals, families and small businesses can\\n              find high-quality, low-cost California government health insurance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIncome Guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about Obamacare income guidelines in California using our\\n              income limits chart, and see if you’re eligible for government assistance.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn More →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnline Services\\n\\n\\n\\n              Learn about the Covered California website.
