Also, it gives you the peace of mind of knowing you have coverage in the case of a “catastrophic event”.  Without coverage, you could end up with a medical bill in the tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars, but with this plan, the highest your medical bill could reach in one year is $7,800 for one person or $15,600 for a family on the standard Bronze Plan, or $6,550 for one person or $13,100 for a family on the Bronze HDHP/HSA Plan.\\n\\nHowever, with lower premiums come higher out-of-pocket costs when you need to use medical services like the emergency room, etc. Most services are subject to the deductible. This means that you will be responsible to pay full price for your services until the deductible is met. For example, you will pay full price for x-rays and emergency room visits until you have reached your deductible.\\n\\nHighlights of the Bronze Plan\\nThe standard Bronze Plan gives you the first 3 cumulative office visits (primary care, specialist, mental health and urgent care visit) for a copay of $65-$95. Note: The HSA Bronze Plan does not include this benefit.\\n\\nThe Bronze plans (like all of the plans) includes free preventative care such as annual physicals (including mammograms and colonoscopies), well-baby checkups, and immunizations.\\n\\nBasic pediatric vision and dental preventative services are included at no charge for children 18 and under.\\n\\n2 Types of Bronze Plans\\nCovered California offers 2 Bronze 60 Plans: The regular Bronze 60 Plan and a Bronze Plan compatible with a Health Savings Account called the Bronze 60 HDHP/HSA plan.\\n\\nBronze 60 Plan – check out this plan for additional limited benefits that are not subject to the deductible.\\nBronze 60 HDHP/HSA Plan – check out this plan for additional tax benefits.\\n\\nIs the Bronze 60 Plan Right for Me?\\nThis plan may be right for you if:\\n\\nYou want a low monthly premium.\\nYou are comfortable with a high deductible, and you mainly want a catastrophic plan.\\nYou are not regularly taking costly prescription drugs.\\nYou are in good health and typically use very few medical services in a year.\\nYour goal is to comply with the Individual Mandate to have health insurance verses having the richest benefits.\\nYour income qualifies you for a subsidy but you do not qualify for Enhanced Silver Plan.\\nYour income does not qualify you for a subsidy and you are age 50 or over. Note: At this age the cost difference between the Bronze and the Silver plans is often greater than $100.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nIf your income does not qualify you for a premium tax credit and you are under age 30, consider the Minimum Coverage Plan\\nIf your income qualifies you for an Enhanced Silver Plan, consider this plan and weigh the added out-of-pocket savings to the premium savings of the Bronze plan.\\nIf you typically use a lot of prescriptions, doctor visits, or other medical services, you may want to consider a Silver, Gold or Platinum.\\n\\nPrice: $\\n\\nPopularity: starstarstarstar\\n\\nDeductible: $6,300 Individual\\n$12,600 Family\\n\\nDoctor Visits: 1st 3 Visits $65-$95\\n\\nGeneric Drugs: Full price up to $500 per script after drug Ded\\n\\nHospital: Full price up to OOP Max\\n\\nOOP Max: $8,200 Individual\\n$16,400 Family\\n\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\n\\nInsurance Company pays:60%\\n\\nYou Pay: 40%',\n 'Chinese Community Health Insurance Coverage\\nFind the Lowest Prices Available on Chinese Community Medical Insurance Plans or Get Discounts Through Our Covered California Options\\nChinese Community Health Plan is diverse as it is unique.

When it comes to your family, having an\\naffordable family health insurance plan is critical. Family health insurance is meant to protect you and your loved\\nones against the expensive costs that come with medical emergencies.\\n\\nMany medical procedures now cost thousands of dollars. Instead of suffering the risk of\\nnot having any health coverage, why not take some time to learn about the different options and select a plan that’s\\nright for your budget?\\n\\nHealth insurance plans for a family in California\\nCalifornia family health insurance is cheaper than most people think. The most popular\\nchoice of affordable family health insurance in California is managed care plans. These types of plans give you\\naccess to a network of hospitals, doctors, clinics and specialists who provide medical services at affordable rates.\\nFor you, this means inexpensive insurance as well as lower premiums, coinsurance and copayments.\\n\\nThe two most common kinds of managed care plans in California are:\\n\\nPPOs (Preferred Provider Organization): PPO plans provide flexible medical\\ncoverage. You and your family will have a primary care physician, but you can see any specialist you want without\\na referral. However, you’ll save more money when you go to an in-network doctor than when you go to an\\nout-of-network doctor.\\nHMOs (Health Maintenance Organization): With HMO plans, you choose a primary\\ncare physician who will be your go-to doctor whenever you need medical care. If you or your family needs\\nspecialist care, your primary doctor will refer you to a specialist.\\nCopayments in HMO plans can be as little as $10. The only disadvantage with HMO plans is\\nthe fact that you can only receive care from doctors in your network plan because other services are not covered\\noutside the network.\\n\\nHow Much Will a Family Plan Cost You Per Month?\\nNaturally, you want to know how much a family health plan will cost you per month, and you can get a free and\\ninstant California health insurance quotes online for your family. How much you pay per month will be\\ndetermined by several factors including:\\n-Your household income\\n-Number of people in your household\\n-Number of people enrolling on the family health plan\\n-Age of each family member\\n-The health plan you choose\\n-ZIP code\\n\\nOn the bronze plan, you’ll make small monthly payments while receiving 60% coverage for\\nmost medical services along with checkups and preventative care. On the silver plan, you’ll make average monthly\\npayments while receiving 70% coverage for basic care and more.\\n\\nOn the gold plan, you’ll make moderate monthly payments while receiving 80% coverage with\\nreasonable copays and no deductibles. On the platinum plan, you’ll make higher payments while receiving 90% coverage\\non regular visits, emergencies and preventative care with $0 deductible.\\n\\nAlso, based on your household income, and if you are not offered insurance through an\\nemployer or spouses employer you could qualify for tax credits, Medi-Cal, C-CHIP or MCAP. For more information on\\nwhether you qualify for subsidies and government assistance, review the Covered\\nCalifornia Income Limits.\\n\\nFinding the Right Family Health Insurance Plan\\nNow that you are more knowledgeable about family health insurance plans in California, we\\nare here to help you find the best coverage. Our online services will provide you with free, instant quotes from the\\ntop insurance companies.\\n\\nTake a few seconds to complete our confidential\\nform. No contact information is needed, and you are under no obligation to buy. Take advantage of our\\nfree, instant quotes to get the family health insurance you’ve been looking for today.',\n 'Covered California Gold 80 Plan: Gold is Golden\\nThe Gold plan shines with its $0 deductible, reasonable copayments, and a price tag that is softer than the top of the line Platinum. Typical services will range from a $30-$65 copay.  Should you ever need to visit the hospital or have a lot of medical needs, the most you would need to pay for covered services in a year would be $7,800 per individual or $15,600 for a family.\\n\\nIs the Covered California Gold Plan Right for Me?\\nIf you don’t like deductibles, then let’s talk more. Not everyone has extra savings lying around to cover a deductible, but would rather pay a little more per month for a plan with copayments they can afford. If you are the kind of person who doesn’t want a plan with a deductible, i.e. the Minimum Coverage, Bronze or Silver plan, and you don’t like the price tag of the more expensive Platinum plan, then the Gold may be just right for you.\\n\\nYou need specific medical services. Advanced lab work such as an MRI, CT, or PET can be pricey on a plan with a deductible. If you anticipate the need for these services, have a scheduled surgery, or are at high risk for occasional  hospital visits then this plan should be up for serious consideration.\\n\\nIf you only frequent the doctor’s office, typically take generic drugs, and are not exposed to risk that takes you to the hospital often, then you may want to look closer at the Silver Plan to see which plan is going to be to your advantage.  Remember, if you can pay the deductible on the Silver plan if needed, then the savings in premium per month is extra money in your pocket.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nLet’s talk about PPO’s and how this would affect a Gold plan.  If you enrolled on a Gold PPO plan, then the benefits described with affiliated copayments only apply when your doctor or medical provider is “In Network” or a “Participating Providers.”  If you were to visit a “Non-Participating Provider” a deductible may be required (some carriers) plus your cost for the services may be higher, oftentimes approximately 20%- 50% (see plan coverage benefit details). In addition, you would have a much higher out-of-pocket maximum, in the event of a “worst case scenario”.  So it is extremely important that you are aware of who is a “Participating Provider” and who is not before receiving your services. If your reason for enrolling in the PPO is to have access to that “Non-Participating” Provider who is an expert in their field, then just make sure you are aware of your portion of the cost so you are not caught by surprise. For additional information, contact the carrier or our agency.\\n\\nPrice: $$$\\n\\nPopularity: star\\n\\nDeductible: None\\n\\nDoctor Visits: $35 – $65\\n\\nGeneric Drugs: $15\\n\\nHospital: $600 per day up to 5 days (most HMO’s)\\n20% (PPO, some HMO’s)\\n\\nOOP Max: $8,700 Individual\\n$17,400 Family\\n\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\n\\nInsurance Company pays: 80%\\n\\nYou Pay: 20%',\n 'The Subsidy or Tax Credit of Healthcare Reform\\nWill the government pay for my health insurance?\\nNot all of it! The government will not pick up the entire tab, but if you enroll in a Covered California health plan, depending on how much money you make, you may qualify for a subsidy that may cover a considerable portion of your monthly premiums. If you make less than 138% of the Federal Poverty Level in California, you qualify for Medi-Cal (otherwise known as Medicaid). If you make over that amount but less than 400% of the federal poverty level based on your household income and number of dependents, then you may be eligible for an up-front subsidy (also referred to as a tax credit)1. View Covered California income limits to determine if you quality.\\n\\nBasically, the government will pay for part of the premium and you will pick up the rest. The amount the government pays initially is dependent on your estimate of what your annual income is expected to be during the year that you apply for health insurance. If at tax time the next year, it turns out that you made less money than predicted, then you will get a tax credit. If you made more, then your taxes will increase to make up for the government’s overpayment on your subsidy. Whether or not you get a subsidy from the government is based on several things: your household income, number of dependents and you being on a Covered California exchange plan.\\n\\nFactors that Go into Getting a Government Subsidy for Your Health Plan\\nHow do I get my subsidy?\\n\\nMost Californians will elect to get their subsidy up front each month. This means the full monthly amount of your subsidy will be deducted from your health insurance premiums. There are two other ways to receive your subsidy. You could deduct a partial amount (the percentage of your choice) from your premiums instead of taking 100% up front each month. This will not lower your monthly premium as much, but you could receive a lump sum payment for the remainder come tax time the next year. Or, you can pay the full amount of your monthly premium and just collect your subsidy at tax time the next year in one large lump sum payment.\\n\\nWhat if I made too much money to qualify for a subsidy?\\nSo what if I make more than 400% of the FPL? Why should I care about the Affordable Care Act? The reason you’ll care is not so you can get a subsidy, but so you can avoid the penalty. In your case there’s no carrot, but there is a stick, and the penalties get more and more severe as we get closer to 2017.\\n\\nIn order to be eligible for the tax credit/subsidy you must not be eligible for any government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance program or military coverage and you must not work for an employer that offers health insurance coverage (unless the employer plan covers less than 60% of the cost of benefits).',\n 'Health Net Health Insurance Coverage\\nAbout Health Net:\\n\\n\\n\\nHealth Net believes every person deserves a safety net for their health, regardless of age, income, employment status or current state of health.

Most health insurance plans in the state are either Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) plans or Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plans. Though either plan can be a good option, your individual needs will impact which type of health insurance plan is right for you.\\n\\nChoosing a Carrier Based on HMO Plans vs. PPO Plans\\nFor many, the decision between Covered California health insurance companies comes down to this question: “What do you think of Kaiser Permanente?” Or, “What do you think of Covered California Kaiser Plans?” Do you want to lock yourself into California’s one-stop shop HMO, or do you want the ability to choose? Is an HMO or a PPO plan right for you?\\n\\nWhat Are HMO Plans?\\nWith an HMO plan, you will have a primary care physician (PCP) who you will visit when you’re sick and for your annual physicals. Though you can select your PCP, they need to be included in the HMO’s network of healthcare providers. If your PCP believes you should receive additional treatment, they will refer you to a specialist in your local network of providers.\\n\\nAn HMO plan offers financial advantages. HMO plans tend to be more affordable with lower monthly premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs — unless you see an out-of-network provider. You will also likely not have to file a claim, since you are seeing physicians in your network and your insurance provider will work with your healthcare providers directly. Your PCP will also take care of coordinating and scheduling the majority of your appointments so you don’t have to deal with this task yourself.\\n\\nWhat Are PPO Plans?\\nA PPO plan is more flexible than an HMO, as you do not need to have a PCP and you can visit any provider or specialist you want. Note that you will save money when you select a physician in your network. Since you have more freedom and flexibility with a PPO plan, you will likely pay more for your monthly premium and pay higher out-of-pocket costs, especially if you visit an out-of-network provider.\\n\\nIf you want to stay with your doctor but have a new insurance provider, you may want to select a PPO plan. Keep in mind that if you choose this type of plan, coordinating and scheduling your appointments will be your responsibility.\\n\\nKaiser vs. Blue Shield\\nKaiser and Blue Shield both offer excellent health insurance plans. If you want an HMO plan, we recommend Kaiser. If you want a PPO plan, we recommend Blue Shield.\\n\\nKaiser Permanente for HMO Plans\\nSome wouldn’t even consider anything but Kaiser Permanente health insurance coverage, California’s premier HMO. Individuals with Kaiser Permanente coverage love walking across the hall from their primary care physician to go see a specialist and then grabbing their prescription drugs on their way out the door. They love Kaiser’s electronic medical record system and how it keeps all their various healthcare providers in the loop regarding health conditions, medications, allergies, past medical history and more.\\n\\nKaiser offers services like disease management programs, 24/7 access to nurses over the phone, discounts on fitness programs and healthy lifestyle classes and programs. It’s a great system, and it works when it comes to offering high-quality health care at affordable prices.\\n\\nBlue Shield/Blue Cross for PPO Plans\\nOthers view the PCP of Kaiser Permanente and the other HMOs as a “gatekeeper” or a prison guard who is keeping them from going straight to a specialist when they deem it necessary. They say things like:\\n\\n“I don’t want to be locked into the Kaiser system.”\\n“I like my current doctor, and I don’t want to change.”\\n“I want choice.”\\nThat’s when it’s time to start looking at the PPOs. If you’re going PPO, that usually means you’ll be looking at Anthem Blue Cross Covered California and Covered California Blue Shield. In the PPO world, you’ll find more options and you’ll likely end up paying more money in monthly premiums to have this choice.\\n\\nFind the Right Plan for You With Health for California\\nAt Health for California, we understand you have a lot of options when it comes to health care coverage. Since 2004, we’ve been helping Californians find plans through a variety of providers. We make it simple for you to get a quick quote for HMO, PPO and other plans based on your unique needs.

Be aware that free health insurance plans are available!\\n\\nObamacare Income Guidelines Chart Based on the Federal Poverty Level\\nAccording to Covered California income guidelines and salary restrictions, if an individual makes less than $47,520 per year or if a family of four earns wages less than $97,200 per year, then they qualify for government assistance based on their income. If the family has a lower household net income, then a greater amount of government assistance is available to the family. Tax deductions can lower your income level. View the Covered California income limits chart below.\\n\\n\\nSilver Enhanced Plans Based on Income\\nBased on your income, you may qualify for Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) on the Silver Plans:\\n\\n0% – 138% of FPL: You qualify for Medi-Cal.*\\n\\n> 138% – 400% of FPL: You qualify for a subsidy on a Covered California plan.\\n\\n> 138% to 150%: You also qualify for the Silver Enhanced 94 Plan.\\n\\n> 150% to 200%: You also qualify for the Silver Enhanced 87 Plan.\\n\\n> 200% to 250%: You qualify for the Silver Enhanced 73 Plan.\\n\\n*Note: Children qualify for Medi-Cal up to 266% of the Federal Poverty Level. So, children would not qualify for CSR / Enhanced Silver Plans 73, 87, or 94.\\n\\nAccording to Covered California income guidelines and salary restrictions, if an individual or family makes less than 400% of FPL, then they qualify for government assistance based on their income.\\n\\n\\nHealth Insurance Income Limits During Pregnancy\\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all marketplace and Medicaid plans need to provide coverage for pregnancy and childbirth. You qualify for pregnancy coverage even if you’re already pregnant when you apply for coverage. It’s important to have health coverage when you’re planning on having a baby for the following reasons:\\n\\nIt makes it easier to get prenatal care: Pregnant women should see their doctors regularly throughout the pregnancy to track the progress and detect any issues. Detecting problems with the pregnancy early on helps ensure the health and safety of you and your baby.\\nIt makes the delivery affordable: The U.S. is known for having one of the highest costs for delivery and maternity care globally. While you might have to pay something out-of-pocket, depending on your income and healthcare coverage, having insurance cuts the cost of delivery considerably.\\nIt gives you access to emergency care: Everyone wants a healthy pregnancy, but complications can occur. Getting immediate access to emergency treatment and care can help save you and the baby.\\n\\nSince having health coverage and getting access to healthcare is critical during pregnancy, the income requirements for pregnant people are slightly different than those for people who aren’t currently expecting a baby. Here’s what you might qualify for, depending on your income level:\\n\\nMedi-Cal: If your earnings fall between 138% and 213% of the poverty level, you may qualify for modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) Medi-Cal during your pregnancy.\\nMedi-Cal Access Program (MCAP): The Covered California income limits for MCAP are between 213% and 322% of the poverty level. MCAP charges a small fee and provides comprehensive coverage for pregnant individuals.\\nWhen you apply for Medi-Cal while pregnant, your eligibility is presumed while your application is reviewed. That means you can take advantage of immediate coverage, ensuring you and your baby get the care you need.\\n\\nIncome Limits for Medi-Cal for Families With Children\\nAdults qualify for Medi-Cal with a household income of less than 138% of FPL. However, according to the Covered California income guide, children who enroll on Obama Care California plans may qualify for Medi-Cal when the family has a household income of 266% or less. The children must be under 19 years of age to qualify. Also, C-CHIP, the County Children’s Health Initiative Program, offers health care coverage for children when the family income is greater than 266% and up to 322% of FPL.\\n\\n\\nHow to Provide Proof of Income\\nDocument proofs (including pay stubs, bank statements, etc.) may be required to verify your household income threshold.

Comparing health plans and obtaining personal health insurance quotes and information has never been easy. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, you have consumer protection on your side.\\n\\nBefore 2014, one could purchase an individual health insurance plan at any time of the year. But as of now, one can only buy individual health insurance during the open enrollment, except for special circumstances.\\n\\nDo I Need Individual Health Insurance?\\nThe Obamacare mandate requires that most people obtain medical insurance coverage. If you are not already enrolled in a health plan that meets the Affordable Care Act minimum essential benefits requirements, you may need to switch plans.\\n\\nThe mandate requires that most Americans and legal residents obtain health insurance that meets the standards set by the Covered California Exchange. Those who do not get covered for health insurance may face a penalty.\\n\\nYou may also need to get Individual Health Insurance in California if:\\n\\nYou are self-employed.\\nYour employer does not offer group plans.\\nYou are enrolled in a group plan, but it does not cover your spouse or dependents.\\nYou are enrolled in a health plan, but the premiums are too high.\\nYou are enrolled in a health plan, but your benefit needs have changed.\\n\\nPros and Cons of Individual Health Insurance\\nFor some, personal health insurance is the only way to meet ACA requirements, If you have the option of group health insurance, personal health insurance plans may still be the better option. It all comes down to which plan best meets your needs.\\n\\nIndividual health insurance has several benefits, such as:\\n\\nMore control: Individual plans allow you to choose from a wider plan selection than just the ones your employer presents to you. You can find a more customized solution that includes what you need and excludes what you don’t.\\nFlexibility: Personal health insurance is not tied to your employment. This can be useful if you are concerned about job loss or changing positions. You can even use it to “close a gap” between an insufficient employer-provided plan and your healthcare needs.\\nChoice of insurer: You can choose from more insurers with an individual plan. Some will have certain benefits, customer service offerings or pricing models that are more appealing to you.\\nOn the other hand, individual health insurance also has some downsides:\\n\\nHigher costs: Often, a group plan is partially paid for by the employer and has lower premiums in the first place. Without these savings, individual plans can be slightly more expensive.\\nPre-existing condition coverage: Individual plans may charge additional fees or lack coverage if you have a pre-existing condition.\\n\\n\\nTypes of Individual Health Insurance\\nIndividual health plans vary in how they are structured and how much they pay for your health costs. Under the ACA, all health plans must meet certain minimum essential coverage, meaning that no one can be denied during the Open Enrollment Period for any pre-existing medical conditions.\\n\\nHealth plans are classified under five major categories to make comparing them easier. The categories are divided according to the percentage of health care costs they pay, and they include the following:\\n\\nPlatinum – Plan pays 90% of your health costs. You pay 10%.\\nGold – Plan pays 80% of your health costs. You pay 20%.\\nSilver – Plan pays 70% of your health costs. You pay 30%.\\nBronze – Plan pays 60% of your health costs. You pay 40%.\\nCatastrophic – These plans are only for people under 30 years or those experiencing financial hardship. These plans pay less than 60% of your health care costs.\\nWith these categories, you’ll also find different structures:\\n\\nHealth maintenance organization (HMO): HMOs provide low out-of-pocket costs with a limited choice of providers and out-of-network coverage only in emergencies. These plans revolve around seeing a primary care doctor who can make specialist referrals.\\nPreferred provider organization (PPO): A PPO has higher out-of-pocket costs than an HMO, but with more flexibility. You don’t need a referral to see a specialist, and you have more provider options, including some coverage for out-of-network providers.\\nExclusive provider organization (EPO): EPOs have lower premiums than PPOs and don’t require referrals, but provider choices are more limited. Seeing an out-of-network provider in a non-emergency setting will not be covered.\\nPoint-of-Service Plan (POS): This kind of plan generally offers more choices of providers than an HMO but still requires referrals for specialists. Like a PPO, in-network care is less expensive than out-of-network care.\\n\\nChoosing the Plan That’s Right for You\\nChoosing a personal health insurance plan that best fits your needs depends on a few different factors. Consider the following aspects and determine how they’ll affect your plan:\\n\\nProvider eligibility and choice: Want to keep your current doctor? Make sure they’re in-network first. Also, make sure you’re comfortable with the providers covered under the plan.\\nMedication eligibility: Medication coverage can vary widely by form, brand and prior approval requirements. If you take regular medications, you’ll want to make sure they’re covered appropriately.\\nPremiums vs. out-of-pocket costs: If you frequently visit the doctor, lower copayments can be easier to manage but will have higher premiums. Alternatively, if you rarely see a doctor, lower premiums and higher out-of-pocket costs might be a good choice.\\nNetwork resources: If you don’t have much patience for phone calls, reimbursements and paperwork, you may want to look for a provider with particularly strong customer service or few requirements on your end.\\n\\nBuying California Individual Health Insurance\\n\\n\\nBefore purchasing personal health insurance, you need to think about your health care needs and budget. Then, compare various plans to find the most suitable fit. Here are some questions you need to consider.\\n\\nHow is the plan structured?\\nWhich providers are in the network?\\nWhat is covered by the plan?\\nHow much out-of-pocket costs do you pay?\\nHow much does the plan pay for your coverage?\\nThink about your budget as well as your health care needs, and find out how much it will cost you in insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs for every plan you consider. Covered California makes it easier to compare different plans and choose the one that fits your individual health needs and budget.\\n\\nMaking a smart choice in health insurance isn’t easy, but the research you do now will pay off later when you need health care for yourself and your family.

It is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS).\\n\\nWhat Is Medi-Cal?\\nEach state runs part of the health care program Medicaid, and Medi-Cal is the version available to qualified individuals in California. With Medicaid for California, if you qualify and apply, can help you pay for doctor’s visits, medication, dental screenings, rehabilitation, surgery, visits to the hospital and more.\\n\\nWho Is Responsible for Medi-Cal?\\nCounty human services departments are responsible for administering the Medi-Cal program at the local level. Recent reports state that more than 14 million Californians are eligible for enrollment in Medi-Cal. Approximately one-third of the state’s population is enrolled in Medi-Cal. More than 80% of enrollees have coverage through the managed care plan while the rest use a fee-for-service system to access care.\\n\\nGetting Started With Medi-Cal Enrollment\\nIf you’re eligible for Medi-Cal, Health for California can help you with your application. We’ll help you apply for a quote online, and our simple application is fast and accurate, so you’ll get the information you need right away. If you need coverage and may qualify for Medi-Cal or would like to compare plans, get a quote from us.\\n\\nApplying for Medi-Cal\\nYou have several options if you want to apply for Medi-Cal. The first step is usually to determine if you’re eligible for the coverage. To do that, look at your household income or review any other programs you qualify for in California.\\n\\nIf you  meet the income requirements or are eligible because of your health or age, you can apply for coverage in the following ways:\\n\\nBy mail\\nIn person\\nOnline\\nWhat Do I Need to Apply?\\nWhen you apply, you’ll need to provide information about yourself and your family. Some of the details you’ll be asked for include:\\n\\nSocial security numbers: You’ll need the Social Security number for each person in your family or those who are part of the application. If you’re an immigrant without a Social Security number, you’ll need to provide your document information instead.\\nEmployment details: You must provide information about your employment status and income with your application. If more than one person in the household works, provide employment details for each person, as their income can affect your overall eligibility.\\nFederal tax information: You’ll also have to provide your federal tax details, such as your filing status and the number of dependents you claim on your return.\\nOther health insurance: If you have health insurance through a job or another insurance policy, you’ll be asked to include information about it on your application.\\nIt’s important to provide as much of the requested information as possible when you submit your application. Not having certain details, such as your tax information or employment information, doesn’t mean you shouldn’t apply. It’s often better to send in your application with as much information as you have than not to apply at all. In fact, you can still get coverage for your children even if you are an undocumented immigrant. You can also be eligible for coverage even if you don’t file a tax return.\\n\\nWhat Is on the Application?\\nAs you fill out the application, it will ask you to provide personal information about everyone in your home. The application will ask for the following:\\n\\nAddress\\nPreferred language\\nWhether you or others in your family have a disability\\nCitizenship or immigration status\\nEmployment and income information\\nRace and ethnicity\\nVeteran status\\nBirthday\\nIf you feel confused about any of the questions on the application or need assistance, Health for California is here to help. If you know you’re eligible for Medi-Cal, it can be worth applying anyway, as you might qualify for a subsidized health insurance plan if you end up not qualifying for Medi-Cal.\\n\\nMedi-Cal Insurance: Understanding the Basics\\nCalifornia has the nation’s largest Medicaid program. There was a huge increase in Medi-Cal enrollments largely due to the expansion that California opted into after the Affordable Care Act was passed which gives aid to a larger range of people. Now, people with slightly higher income are able to receive Medi-Cal regardless of disability, family status, financial resources, and other factors that were usually taken into account in eligibility decisions.\\n\\nMedi-Cal for Immigrants\\nAs of May 1, 2016, California’s undocumented low-income children (under the age of 19) have access to full coverage through Medi-Cal.\\n\\nMost adults who are undocumented do not qualify for Medi-Cal. However, they may qualify for some of the coverage during pregnancy or emergencies.\\n\\nIn most cases, adults who are immigrants and have been legal residents for at least five years or meet other requirements qualify for Medi-Cal. However, even immigrants who are legal residents but do not qualify for Medi-Cal may qualify for assistance in getting insurance if they’re at or below 400 percent of the FPL (Federal Poverty Level).\\n\\nWhat May Be Covered by Medi-Cal?\\nMedi-Cal provides a range of health benefits, including the following 10 “essential health benefits” required by the Affordable Care Act for all health plans:\\n\\nOutpatient (ambulatory) services\\nEmergency services\\nHospitalization\\nMaternity and newborn care\\nMental health and substance use disorder services, including behavioral health treatment\\nPrescription drugs\\nPrograms such as physical and occupational therapy (known as rehabilitative and habilitative services) and devices\\nLaboratory services\\nPreventive and wellness services and chronic disease management\\nChildren’s services, including oral and vision care\\n\\nUnderstanding Your Medi-Cal Benefits\\nYour Medi-Cal benefits will depend on how you qualify for Medi-Cal. Some patients get full-scope Medi-Cal, meaning they qualify for all Medi-Cal coverage. Some patients eligible for partial-scope Medi-Cal will be covered only for some services. It’s important to understand what is and what may not be covered for you.\\n\\nThe Medi-Cal Health Benefits Chart provides more details about specific services in the above categories. Medi-Cal also offers certain dental benefits for adults and children, and full-scope Medi-Cal members are offered vison benefits.\\n\\nYour Medi-Cal benefits will depend on how you qualify for Medi-Cal. Some patients get full-scope Medi-Cal, meaning they qualify for all Medi-Cal coverage. Some patients eligible for partial-scope Medi-Cal will be covered only for some services. It’s important to understand what is and what may not be covered for you.\\n\\nMedi-Cal also offers certain dental benefits for adults and children, and full-scope Medi-Cal members are offered vison benefits.\\n\\nTo improve its services, the DHCS states that to improve members’ access to services and to ensure they spend tax dollars efficiently, “nearly 80 percent of its members now receive care from a Medi-Cal managed care plan. Under these models access to health care is easier and the quality of care is improved.”*\\n\\nHow You Get Medical Care Under Medi-Cal\\nPlan options vary depending on the county you reside in. Most counties offer commercial plans including Anthem Blue Cross, Kaiser Permanente, Health Net, and Molina. Other counties offer public plans administered by the community. If a county only administers one plan, then all Medi-Cal members will be enrolled in that plan. Almost all Medi-Cal plans are “managed care plans” which means they function similar to an HMO. Medi-Cal Plans can be found in the Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Plan Directory.\\n\\nA managed care plan means you’ll have a primary care physician, and they’re the one person you’ll see if you need medical care. If you need to see another doctor or specialist, your primary care physician must refer you to that medical care provider if you want that visit covered by Medi-Cal. In the event of an emergency, however, you are not limited to a specific hospital.\\n\\nAfter You Have Selected a Plan\\nOnce the plan is selected, a doctor or doctor’s group must be chosen. Medi-Cal members must use a Medi-Cal doctor and facility that is in the group and plan that they have been enrolled in. Members can search for Medi-Cal Doctors on the Medi-Cal Managed Care Health Care Options Website.\\n\\nIn some areas, only “Fee-For-Service” Medi-Cal is offered – contact Medi-Cal for how Fee-For-Service Medi-Cal works.\\n\\nThe Future is Here\\nThe California DHCS seeks to fulfill its vital role as California’s health care safety net by having the following mission and vision:\\n\\n“…to provide Californians with access to affordable high-quality health care, including medical, dental, mental health, substance use disorder services, and long-term services and supports…and to preserve and improve the physical and mental health of all Californians.” *\\n\\nIf you’re ready to sign up for Medi-Cal or another health insurance program, get a quote from Health for California today.

The Minimum Coverage plan usually has the least expensive premium with the highest deductible and is mostly a catastrophic plan that protects you from “worst-case scenarios”. What many people don’t know is that it offers some free services that can make this plan quite attractive to those on a tighter budget and who normally don’t use very many medical services. The highlights of this plan are below:\\n\\nIt is available to people who are under age 30.*\\nThis plan does not qualify for a subsidy through Covered California. You would be paying the full price for this plan. If you qualify for premium assistance, you may pay less for a Bronze Plan.\\nThis plan includes free preventative care.\\nThis plan also includes 3 free primary care office visits (in-network only) per person per year that are in-network only.\\nThis plan has a $8,150 individual deductible and $16,300 on a family basis. This means you pay full cost for all your medical services until or if you meet the deductible.\\nThe out of pocket maximum is $8,150 for an individual and $16,300 for a family. Once your deductible has been met, your out of pocket is also met, and your insurance kicks in at 100% for all in-network services until the end of the calendar year.\\n\\nIs the Minimum Coverage Plan Right for Me?\\nThe most important consideration for the Minimum Coverage plan is whether or not you qualify for a premium tax credit. View Covered California income limits to determine this.\\n\\nIf you do not qualify for a subsidy, then this plan might fit your needs best in the following situations:\\n\\nYou are under age 30.*\\nYou are comfortable with a high deductible plan.\\nYou are in good health and typically use very few medical services in a year.\\nYour goal is to comply with the Individual Mandate, avoid the penalty and get health insurance in the cheapest way possible.\\nYou are seeking a child only plan.**\\nminimun-coverage\\n\\nPrice: $\\n\\nPopularity: starstar\\n\\nDeductible: $9,450 Individual\\n$18,900 Family\\n\\nDoctor Visits: 1st 3 Visits Free\\n\\nGeneric Drugs: Full price until OOP max\\n\\nHospital: Full price until OOP max\\n\\nOOP Max:\\n$9,450 Individual\\n$18,900 Family\\n\\nMinimum Coverage Plan vs. Bronze 60 plan\\nWhen comparing these 2 plans, the main factors are the premium cost, the 3 free primary care office visits a year, and the deductible. The Minimum Coverage plan usually wins on premium cost, and, since the first 3 primary care visits a year are free, it gives better benefits than the  Bronze 60. But the Bronze 60 plan will save you $300 for an individual if you experience unexpected high medical costs and you meet your deductible. Also, you may qualify for premium assistance if you choose the Bronze Plan.\\n\\nOn the Minimum Coverage plan, you can save around $30/month depending on age, area, and insurance carrier. Generally, the older you are, the more cost savings you’ll see on the Minimum Coverage plan compared to the regular Bronze 60 plan. Also, if you live in an area that has a higher cost of living, you are going to see larger savings in premiums with the Minimum Coverage Plan over the regular Bronze 60 Plan.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nSome people express concern about having the money to pay the $7,1500 individual deductible should something major happen during the year. Not to worry, many of the carriers have payment plans but you need to ask about it as they may not bring it up unless you do.\\n\\n* The Minimum Coverage plan may be available for those who are 30 and above under certain circumstances. If your income is too high to qualify for a subsidy and the cost of the cheapest bronze plan in your area is over 8% of your household income, you may qualify for a hardship exemption. For more information about this or other hardship exemptions give us a call at 707-571-7590 or visit hardship exemptions.\\n** If your enrollment is for a child only you do not qualify for premium assistance, so there is no need to consider switching to a Bronze Plan for financial assistance.\\n\\n',\n 'Molina Health Insurance Coverage\\nFind the Lowest Prices Available on Molina Medical Insurance Plans or Get Discounts Through Our Covered California Options\\nDr. C.

In the midst of setting up the nursery, making extra trips to the doctor for prenatal appointments and securely fastening your brand new baby car seat, it’s surprisingly easy to forget about getting a plan in place for newborn health insurance coverage. Whether you, as a parent, have health insurance, but don’t know much about it, or don’t have health insurance at all, navigating the process of getting your newborn health insurance coverage can be tough.\\n\\nUnfortunately, health insurance for newborns isn’t something that just happens on its own. While there is a short buffer period built in to give newborn’s coverage through his/her mother’s insurance, the longer you wait to get newborn insurance coverage in California, the more you will end up having to pay. While the Affordable Care Act and California State Laws make it mandatory for health insurance companies to accept newborns to health insurance plans, there’s no guarantee on pricing. If you fail to do your part to get your newborn on a health insurance plan, you could end up spending a significant amount of money.\\n\\nRisk of Not Having Newborn Insurance Coverage in California\\nCare for newborns tops the list as most expensive insurance claims. The key to minimizing cost and making sure your new addition is covered is planning. There’s a lot to do when you’re planning for a new member of the family, especially in those first 30 days. If you haven’t decided what to do about getting insurance for your newborn in California before your little one arrives, it can be easy to forget insurance coverage in the midst of adjusting to life as a parent. When you do remember, there’s often paperwork that needs to be completed, and coverage isn’t instant — leaving your new bundle of joy at risk of being without health insurance, and you with the significant financial burden that comes with post-partum out-of-pocket expenses. So what can you do to ensure your baby is protected?\\n\\nIndividual or Employer Insurance Plan Doesn’t Cover a New Baby\\nAvoid financial burdens when you apply for newborn health insurance through Health for CaliforniaIf you have your health insurance policy, your baby is born into coverage, right? Sort of. For the first 30 days of your newborn’s life, he or she will be covered as an extension of the mother, under her policy and her deductible. Starting on day 31 of the newborn’s life, your baby will need to have his or her policy. That policy could simply mean adding your newborn to your employer insurance plan, or turning your individual plan into a family plan; but don’t forget that takes time, paperwork and money. If you don’t have a plan in place to get coverage immediately after your little one is born, you’ll miss out on having some of those first few well-baby checkups completely covered. If your baby goes even one day without coverage between being on the mother’s insurance and being added to his or her own insurance plan, you could be subject to an additional 20% cost penalty during the first year of your baby’s health insurance coverage — which is already the most expensive year for health insurance.\\n\\nParents Don’t Have Health Insurance\\nIf the mother and father of a newborn do not have health insurance, then all expenses must be paid out of pocket. A recent study found the average price tag for vaginal deliveries and c-sections in California fall between $15,000 and $45,000. That’s a huge financial burden for new parents to take on. If that isn’t enough of a reason for you to get health insurance before your newborn arrives, the possibility of putting the baby’s health at risk should be.\\n\\nAlthough newborn babies are covered under their mother’s health insurance policy for the first 30 days, not every mother has health insurance. In this case, babies whose mothers do not have health insurance are not covered. Complications that arise during birth or shortly after will continue to add to the financial burden.\\n\\nEven without complications, there are several essential doctors’ appointments during the first 18 months of a child’s life. These office visits are considered preventative care and are covered if you have health insurance. Without it, you either skip the appointments, which can be detrimental to your child’s development and health, or you pay for all of those appointments out of pocket. Not having insurance for a newborn is significantly more expensive than it is for an adult.\\n\\nOptions Provided by Health for California\\nWhile everyone welcoming a new baby into their life is going to see an increase in health insurance costs, being proactive can ensure that those costs are manageable. The reason it’s important to plan to get insurance for newborns in California is that you need time to gather quotes and review benefits. Health for California is a great place to start, and it can save you a lot of time.\\n\\nHealth for California is a health insurance agency that has developed a free, no obligation, one-stop-shop website for health insurance quotes — regardless of whether you’re searching for a new family plan, or child-only health insurance plan. It is certified to give Covered California quotes as well as private insurance company quotes. The simple online form asks you a few basic questions and provides a list of health insurance plan results that you can compare side by side.\\n\\nHealth for California can give you quotes on the following:\\n\\nIndividual Health Insurance\\nGroup Health Insurance\\nChild-Only Health Insurance Quotes\\nCovered California Plans\\n\\nChild-Only Health Insurance Quotes California\\nFind newborn health insurance coverage with Health for CaliforniaIf you and your partner don’t have insurance and don’t plan on getting insurance, a child-only health insurance plan makes the most sense. However, parents that have insurance may also want to consider a child-only policy for the following reasons:\\n\\nIt’s more expensive to add your newborn to your pre-existing plan.\\nYou’re paying for health insurance for your newborn, but they won’t be living with you.\\nYou’re paying for health insurance for your newborn, but they’re not a part of your tax household.\\n\\nCovered California Quotes for Individuals and Families\\nThe Covered California Health Exchange is a government agency that helps Californians comply with Obamacare. To comply with Obamacare, you need to have insurance coverage from a qualified health plan that meets the government’s requirements. While you usually can only enroll during the open enrollment period, the birth of a child gives you the ability to apply for Covered California health insurance outside of the open enrollment period.\\n\\nParents who are expecting a newborn may want to consider shopping for a new insurance plan for the following reasons:\\n\\nThe cost of adding your newborn to your pre-existing plan is high.\\nYou and your partner do not currently have insurance.\\nYou and your partner would like to get on an insurance plan together when the child is born.\\nFill out a simple online form with some basic information, including your income, and you’ll see a variety of plans in your search results. The details you will be able to compare include:\\n\\nCarrier Name (Kaiser Permanente, Anthem Blue Cross, etc.)\\nPlan Category (EPO, PPO, HMO)\\nPlan Type (Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze HSA or Bronze)\\nFull Price of Plan\\nPrice You Pay\\nSubsidy Amount You Qualify For\\nLink to “View Benefits”\\nYour income level may qualify you for discounted rates — all of which you can find on the Health for America website. There are additional parameters for pregnant women with low incomes, too. As a female who is expecting, you could qualify for Medi-Cal. Entering your household income information in the optional section of the forms will ensure all of the plans you are eligible for will appear in the results.\\n\\nSteps to Get Your Newborn Insurance Coverage in California\\nhospital child birth in California is about $15,000 and $45,000As the mother and father of the newborn, you may share a health insurance policy, or you may have two separate policies. You may both be a part of a group plan through your employer, or you may each have individual insurance plans. Since California allows newborns to be added to either mother or father’s insurance policy, regardless of marital status, several scenarios may exist for mothers and father when it comes to getting insurance for a newborn in California.\\n\\nThe ultimate goal is to find the health insurance policy that offers the best value for your newborn. Once you’ve decided on a health insurance plan that’s fits of your new addition, you can always change months or years down the road if you find a health insurance policy that has better benefits or a more affordable cost. Obtaining insurance for your newborn is important, but it doesn’t have to be a plan that lasts forever.\\n\\nThe Mother and/or Father Has Health Insurance Through an Employer\\nIf you have a group health insurance policy through your employer, start by talking to your human resources office. Here are a few questions you should ask:\\n\\nHow much will it cost to add my newborn to my group plan?\\nWhat are the benefits that are included in that price? Are there any specific to newborns?\\nWhat paperwork do I need to fill out to add my newborn to my group plan?\\nWhat is the deadline to have the paperwork submitted?\\nWhen will the coverage start?\\nThe mother and father of the baby should compare notes on how much it will cost to add the child to the group plan and should also review the benefits of each plan to determine the best value. If one parent has health insurance through an employer, and the other parent has an individual health insurance plan, review the cost and the benefits to see which policy is best for your newborn.\\n\\nThe Mother and/or Father Has an Individual or Family Health Insurance Plan\\nIf you have an individual or family health insurance plan, call your insurance company directly and talk to them about what options they offer for adding a newborn to your plan. You should ask them questions such as:\\n\\nHow much will it cost to add my newborn to my individual or family plan?\\nWhat process do I need to follow to get my newborn added to my plan?\\nWhen will coverage begin for my newborn?\\nWill the coverage for my newborn be the same as my coverage?\\nIf this is not your first child, you may be pleasantly surprised to find that the increase you had with the first baby will not occur with your second or third. It’s also important to note that when you add another child to the family, it’s often worth revisiting health insurance plans for the entire family. For example, you may have your child on a separate plan, but now that you have two children, there may be a better family plan rate available.\\n\\nIf parents are not on the same individual or family health plan, it’s important to compare coverage to see whether the mother or father’s health insurance policy offers the better value for the newborn. This may also be an opportunity to get more value from your health insurance policy by searching for a family health insurance policy that covers both parents and the new child.\\n\\nNeither Parent Has Health Insurance\\nNewborns are the most expensive insurance claimsIf insurance is available through the mother or father’s employer, talk to the human resources office about what coverage is available. Remember that in California, a newborn can be added to a mother or father’s policy within the first 30 days. The parents of the child do not need to be married.\\n\\nIf insurance is not available through an employer, begin shopping for an insurance policy. Whether you’re searching for an individual plan that you can eventually add your child to or a child-only insurance plan that will cover your child, search online through the Health for California to learn what coverage is available and how much it will cost. You can also learn more about the different categories of plans as you browse our website to see what plan offers the best value for you and your newborn.\\n\\nDon’t Get Stuck Without Newborn Insurance Coverage in California.\\nNeglecting to plan to get health insurance for your newborn will result in significant financial burdens. If a mother has a child without insurance in California, she could owe up to $45,000 for the delivery of her child alone. Even if both parents have insurance, failing to get a plan in place for their newborn to have coverage on day 31, after the 30 days of coverage as an extension of the mother, can result in paying an additional 20% more the entire first year as a penalty for not having coverage.\\n\\nAt Health for California, our goal is to make it easy for Californians to get the health insurance coverage they need for themselves and their newborn. Our website is focused on educating those who may not know much about health insurance, and to make it easy to find an affordable health insurance solution for mothers, fathers and children. Begin your new adventure as parents by requesting a free, no obligation quote on our website so you can be sure your newborn has the best health insurance plan from the moment they arrive.\\n\\n',\n 'Covered California 2023-2024 Open Enrollment Period: Nov. 1 – Jan. 31\\nOpen enrollment is the period during which people can purchase health insurance for the upcoming year. During Open Enrollment you can apply without a Qualifying Life Event.\\n\\nWhen Is the Open Enrollment Period for Obamacare 2023-2024?\\nOpen Enrollment for Covered California begins on November 1, 2023 and continues until January 31, 2024.\\n\\nWhat if I want to apply and it’s not Open Enrollment?\\nThe only other way to buy an insurance plan outside of open enrollment is to qualify for special enrollment. This time frame is called the Special Enrollment Period (SEP). This exception allows you to apply for health insurance if you’ve had certain qualifying life events, such as:\\n\\nLosing your job\\nMoving to a new state\\nGetting married or divorced\\nBecoming a widow or widower\\nAging off your parent’s plan\\nHaving a new baby\\nNote that you won’t be eligible for special enrollment if you lost your previous health plan because you failed to pay your monthly premiums or if you voluntarily cancelled the coverage.\\n\\nWhat Are Your Options During Open Enrollment?\\nDepending on your current situation, you have the following options.\\n\\nBuy a plan through Covered California. You may want to buy a plan through the marketplace if you qualify for a tax credit to help offset your premiums. Qualifying usually depends on your income and household size. Your total household income must be between 128% and 400% of the federal poverty level, or FPL.\\nRenew or change your current plan. During the open enrollment period, you can renew your existing plan. You won’t have to do anything if you want to keep what you have. But if your current plan is changing — for instance, your PCP is leaving the network, or your drugs aren’t in the list of covered medications — then you may want to switch to a plan that best suits your current needs. If you need to change policies, the open enrollment period is the best time.\\nEnroll in Medi-Cal. If your income is below 128% of the Federal Poverty Level, you qualify for Medi-Cal, which is Medicaid for Californians.\\n\\nWhich Health Insurance Options Don’t Use Open Enrollment?\\nMost health insurers in California use some sort of open enrollment program. But there are a few exceptions:\\n\\nMedi-Cal: Medi-Cal doesn’t limit enrollment to the open enrollment period. If you’re eligible for Medi-Cal, you’re allowed to enroll anytime.\\nCHIP: The Children’s Health Insurance Program doesn’t limit enrollment to a specific time, either.\\n',\n '\\nCovered California Platinum 90 Plan: Top of the Line\\nThink the “Rolls-Royce” of the Covered California Metal Plan Portfolio. The Platinum plan offers a much smaller out of pocket expense when it comes time for doctor’s visits, labs, prescriptions, etc. in exchange for a higher premium per month. This plan features an attractive $0 deductible with minimal copays of $15-$30 for common services.  And to top it off, if the worst should happen, the most you would have to pay in a year for covered services would be $4,500 for an individual or $9,000 for a family. This is the best of any plan offered on the Covered California Exchange. The only exception to this would be if you qualify for the Silver 87 or Silver 94 plans.\\n\\nIs the Platinum Plan Right for Me?\\nIt may be the perfect for you:\\n\\nIf you want benefits similar to what you had through an employer. Oftentimes, the Platinum is the closest. To compare your previous plan to this one, feel free to contact our agency so we can compare apples to apples for you.\\n\\nYou don’t want a deductible, and you want the lowest out-of-pocket maximum in the event of a worst case scenario.\\n\\nYou have health needs that require a lot of services.\\nThis plan may also be a good fit if you have a planned event, such as having a baby or if you know you will need a particular surgery or procedure that will be expensive. Once you utilize the plan for your coverage needs, you can always switch to another level of coverage if desired, during the next year’s open enrollment. The open enrollment typically takes place at the end of the calendar year and lasts 1-2 months. So keep this in mind as you plan.\\n\\nFor other people it is enough that the Platinum level of coverage offers peace of mind that you just can’t put a price tag on.\\n\\nIn comparing other metal plans ask yourself, “Does the premium justify the amount of times I would use the coverage?”  If not, it may be to your interest to take a little more risk, pay less for either a Silver or Gold plan, and put the premium savings to use by saving it for unexpected events that may require a little extra money up front.\\n\\nplatinum\\n\\nPrice: $$$$\\n\\nPopularity: starstar\\n\\nDeductible: None\\n\\nDoctor Visits: $15\\n\\nRx: $30\\n\\nHospital: $250 per day up to 5 days (HMO)\\n10% (PPO)\\n\\nOOP Max: $4,500 Individual\\n$9,000 Family\\n\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\n\\nInsurance Company pays:\\n90%\\n\\nYou Pay: 10%\\n\\nA Little More To Think About\\nWe have quite a few people that are concerned with good emergency room coverage that doesn’t break the bank.For many people this is what they are looking for.\\n\\nIf you are considering a PPO Platinum plan, be aware that if you receive care “Out of Network” you may have a deductible (some carriers) to reach along with higher out of pocket costs than what you see on the standard benefits. For example on the standard benefits you would pay $ 40 to see a specialist. If you were to see a specialist “Out of Network” you may pay a deductible (some carriers) and then 50% of the cost. Check your plan benefit details for more information so you aren’t caught by surprise.  For additional information, contact the carrier or Health For California Insurance Center.\\n\\n',\n 'Preventive Care\\nPreventive care aims to help detect and prevent small health problems before becoming big health risks. It is a provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) whose purpose is to keep people healthier by removing cost barriers for preventive care services and to lower health care costs overall.\\n\\nBecause of Obama Care in California, preventive care is now free on most plans.  This means these specific services are not subject to the deductible and you do not have to pay a co-pay or any co-insurance. This is true of all private non-grandfathered health plans that became effective September23, 2010 or after. In addition, there are specific free preventive services for women on plans that became effective August1, 2012 or after.\\n\\nPreventive Care Services\\nFor all adults\\n\\nBlood pressure screening\\nCertain immunizations\\nCholesterol screening for adults of certain ages or at higher risk\\nColorectal cancer screening for adults over 50\\nDiabetes (Type 2) screening for adults with high blood pressure\\nOther services for adults\\nFor women\\n\\n\\n\\nBreast cancer mammography screenings every 1- 2 years for women over 40\\nCervical cancer screening for sexually active women\\nContraception and contraceptive devices\\nOsteoporosis screening for women over age 60 depending on risk factors\\nWell-woman visits to get recommended services for women under 65 including preconception care, prenatal care and breastfeeding support and equipment\\nOther services for women\\nFor children\\n\\nBehavioral assessments for certain age ranges through age 17\\nCertain immunizations\\nHearing screening for all newborns\\nHeight, weight and body mass index (BMI) measurements for certain age ranges through age 1\\nOral health risk assessments for children of certain age ranges through age 10\\nVision screening for all children\\nOther services for children\\nWhen Preventive Care Services Are Not Free\\nPreventative services are not free if obtained through an out-of-network provider. If the primary reason of your office visit is for diagnostic care, then you most likely will have to pay. This means that if the majority of your visit addresses health problems you are already having, then your visit is not a preventive care visit. It can also depend on how your doctor’s office codes the visit. If the preventive service is billed separately from the office visit, the preventive service must be free, but the office visit may have a cost. If you receive treatment given as a result of a preventive service visit but the actual treatment itself is not considered a preventive service, then you may have to pay.\\n\\nHow to Make Sure Your Preventive Care Services are Free\\nMake sure you visit in-network doctors and providers\\nWhen scheduling your appointment, make sure to say it’s for your free annual preventative care exam\\nAt the appointment, ask your doctor to code your service as a preventive care visit\\nIf you need a more costly service such as a colonoscopy, ask a number of providers how the service will be billed before you make your appointment, and work with your insurance company to find out how to obtain most if not all of the service for free\\n\\n',\n 'Qualifying Life Events\\nf you wish to enroll in a health plan and it’s not currently an open enrollment period, you will need to have a qualifying life event (QLE). A life event is generally a significant change that occurs in your life. This could be a change to your family, your residence, your previous health coverage, and a number of other things. Without a life event you won’t be able to enroll in a new plan until the next open enrollment period.\\n\\nEach QLE carries some fairly strict guidelines in order for it to qualify you for a special enrollment period. Click on one of the life events listed below for more info.\\n\\nLost my health insurance including Medi-Cal\\nIf you’ve lost or will soon lose Minimum Essential Coverage (MEC) health insurance, you may qualify for special enrollment. In order to qualify, you must not have lost your coverage voluntarily. That means, for example, you do not qualify if your coverage was cancelled because you weren’t able to pay for it. However, if you had employer-sponsored coverage and lost your job, you probably lost your coverage as well. In this case you would qualify and may enroll in a plan. Consumers (new and existing) who have an involuntary loss of MEC will have a unique 120 day special enrollment period in which they can apply – up to 60 days before and 60 days after the loss event date.\\n\\nAnother common example is someone who loses their Medi-Cal coverage. Perhaps you’ve been on Medi-Cal for a while, and then you receive a raise on your job or start working more hours. If your increased income pushes you above the threshold for Medi-Cal and it’s cancelled, you would qualify for special enrollment.\\n\\nMore examples:\\n\\nCOBRA coverage expires (cannot be for non-payment)\\nYou don’t qualify for student health coverage anymore\\nYou don’t qualify for a family plan anymore because you turned 26\\nYou don’t qualify for a child-only plan anymore because you turned 19\\n\\n\\n\\nPermanently moved to/within California\\nIf you moved to California from another state in the last 60 days, you qualify for special enrollment.\\n\\nIf you moved within California, from one residence to another, you MAY qualify for special enrollment. In order for this to be the case, there must be at least one Covered CA plan available to you at your new address that was not available to you before.\\n\\nConsumers with this type of life event are not required to have had prior coverage in order to qualify for special enrollment.\\n\\n\\n\\nHad a baby\\nIf you had a baby, adopted a child, or received a child into foster care in the last 60 days, your entire family qualifies for special enrollment.\\n\\nAlso, you qualify for special enrollment if your child was placed for adoption or foster care.\\n\\nNote:\\nIf your qualifying event involves foster care you will need to select “adopted a child”\\n\\n\\n\\nAdopted a child\\nIf you adopted a child, had a baby, or received a child into foster care in the last 60 days, your entire family qualifies for special enrollment.\\n\\nAlso, you qualify for special enrollment if your child was placed for adoption or foster care.\\n\\nNote:\\nIf your QLE involves foster care you will need to select “adopted a child”\\n\\n\\n\\nGot married\\nIf you got married in the last 60 days, you and your spouse qualify for special enrollment and may purchase a health plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nEntered into domestic partnership\\nIf you entered into a legally recognized domestic partnership in the last 60 days, you and your partner qualify for special enrollment and may purchase a health plan.\\n\\nReturned from active duty military service\\nIf you’ve lost coverage in the last 60 days due to leaving active duty, reserve duty, or the California National Guard, you qualify for special enrollment and may purchase a health plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nReleased from incarceration (jail or prison)\\nIf you were released from jail or prison in the last 60 days, you qualify for special enrollment and may purchase a health plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nGained citizenship/lawful presence\\nIf you became a citizen, a national, or a permanent legal resident of the U.S. in the last 60 days, you qualify for special enrollment and may purchase a health plan.\\n\\n\\n\\nAmerican Indian/Alaska Native\\nIf you are an American Indian/Alaska Native and are a member of a federally recognized tribe, you can enroll at any time throughout the year regardless of enrollment period. You may also change health plans up to once a month.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther qualifying life event\\nIf none of the events listed above apply to you, you may be able to select “Other Qualifying Life Event” if:\\n\\nyou currently have a Covered California plan and become eligible or ineligible for cost sharing reductions or tax credits.\\nwhen you applied, misconduct or misinformation occurred on the part of your authorized representative, or incorrect eligibility or plan information occurred during enrollment.\\nyou’re enrollment was affected by technical issues on Covered California’s website.\\nyour health plan violated its contract.\\nyou experienced a natural disaster or medical emergency near the open enrollment deadline.\\nHealth and Human Services issued you a certificate of exemption but you lost exemption outside of open enrollment.\\na child you’ve been ordered to provide insurance for is ineligible for Medi-Cal and CHIP, regardless of whether or not you plan to claim the child on your taxes.\\nyou entered or ended AmeriCorps/VISTA/National Civilian Community Corps outside of an open enrollment period.\\nyou’re currently on a “grandfathered” or “non-grandfathered” plan outside of Covered California, and your plan is set to renew outside of open enrollment, but you and would like to switch to a Covered California plan instead.\\nyour provider left the network while you were being treated for any of the following:\\npregnancy\\nterminal illness\\nan acute condition\\na serious chronic condition\\nthe care of a newborn between 0 and 36 months\\na surgery or other procedure that will occur within 180 days of the termination or start date.\\n\\n\\nNone of the above\\nIf you do not have a QLE listed above, you can still apply to see if you qualify for Medi-Cal or the Medi-Cal Access Program (MCAP) for pregnant women based on your income and family size regardless of enrollments periods. Your application will be screened for eligibility in these programs no matter which qualifying event is selected.',\n 'Reporting Changes to Covered California\\nOnce you have enrolled, you are required to report information on your Covered California Application that changes.  Changes like income or household size may occur during the year that could affect the assistance that you qualify for.

Though the cost of health insurance for self-employed workers always seems to be rising, you may be able to deduct 100% of health insurance premiums you pay for yourself, your dependents and your spouse, up to set limits.\\n\\nUse this guide to help you navigate your options for California health insurance as a self-employed worker or small business owner. We can help you find the affordable health insurance you need to protect your health and the health of your loved ones.\\n\\nSelf-Employed vs. Small Business\\nBefore you can find the best health insurance plan for you, you need to determine whether you need self-employed health insurance coverage or small business health insurance coverage.\\n\\nSelf-Employed Health Insurance\\nIf you are a self-employed worker, you can enroll in high-quality, flexible individual health insurance coverage. You are considered a self-employed individual if you have a business that makes money but does not have employees. Self-employed individuals are often considered independent contractors, consultants or freelancers.\\n\\nAs a self-employed California resident, you can fill out an application for a health plan, which will help you determine whether you are eligible for:\\n\\nLow-cost or free coverage: Completing an application will help you determine whether you are eligible for low-cost or free coverage through Covered California or Medicaid, which will also depend on your household’s size and your income.\\nA premium tax credit: Filling out an application can help you determine whether you qualify for savings like a premium tax credit. What you qualify for will vary based on your household size and income.\\nWhile filling out the application, you will need to estimate your net income. Your savings depend on your estimated net self-employment income for the year you are obtaining coverage rather than your income from the previous year.\\n\\nYou can then select from different health care coverage categories. Those include health plans with low premiums that are most useful in worst-case scenarios to health plans with higher premiums and lower out-of-pocket costs if you receive health care services.\\n\\nSmall Business Health Insurance\\nOn the other hand, if your business has an employee other than yourself, you may need small business health insurance. Employees are typically workers whose income is reported on W-2 forms.\\n\\nWhen shopping for small business health insurance, you will want to find a plan that fits your budget and your employees’ budgets. You choose what level of coverage is offered and how much you will contribute to their health insurance premiums. You will also select from preferred provider organization (PPO) and health maintenance organization (HMO) plans from various providers.\\n\\nWhen you choose small business health insurance, you can offer your employees financial protection and peace of mind in the event of illness or a major accident. You can also control costs by selecting the health plan that best fits your budget and employees’ needs.\\n\\nBest Health Insurance Options for the Self-Employed\\nSide hustles and self-employment are on the rise. If you are one of the millions of Americans who are self-employed, you may be concerned about whether you can find affordable, quality health insurance.\\n\\nGenerally, you can sign up for a health plan during open enrollment. This open enrollment period begins Nov. 1 every year and typically ends in December. A qualifying life event may also allow you to enroll in a health insurance plan. Qualifying life events include:\\n\\nLosing previous health insurance\\nHaving a child\\nGetting married\\nBelow, we break down how to find the best health insurance for self-employed California workers.\\n\\nThe Cost of Health Insurance for Self-Employed Workers\\nA few factors can influence the cost of a self-employed health insurance plan that is compliant with the Affordable Care Act, including:\\n\\nLocation\\nAge\\nDeductible\\nTobacco use\\nIncome level\\nPlan category\\nIndividual versus family plans\\nSome states have set rules that determine how much each of these factors can affect your monthly premiums. Premiums for tobacco users and older workers can be significantly higher. If you live in an urban area, you may pay more for health insurance than someone who lives in a rural area. But insurance companies cannot charge you more for health insurance based on your medical history, current health status or gender.\\n\\nA health plan that has a lower premium may be called a high-deductible or catastrophic plan. With this type of plan, you will pay a lower monthly premium. But if you do need health care services, you will pay out-of-pocket for some costs before your insurance begins covering costs. If you are young and in good health, this may be a good option for you.\\n\\nOther health plans have a higher premium but lower deductibles. If you are older or have a pre-existing condition and know you will need ongoing prescriptions or care from specialists, you may want to consider this type of plan. More coverage may mean you pay less over time.\\n\\nCoverage Options for Self-Employed Workers\\nWhether you are working a temporary side gig or own a business can influence what type of health insurance is the right option for you. When you’re your own boss and in charge of everything, this involves various considerations. To help you determine what self-employed health insurance plans may be right for you, understand a few of your options.\\n\\nFor example, if you are laid off from your full-time job, you may decide to do some freelance work while you apply for full-time employment opportunities. In this case, you may need a short-term health insurance solution to protect you in the time between full-time employment. Examples of that and other options include:\\n\\nShort-term insurance: If you want to save on your premium, you may consider short-term health insurance. You can usually have this insurance for a few months, and you can sign up for a plan outside of the open enrollment period. Your premium will be low, but your out-of-pocket costs will be high and your plan may not cover any pre-existing conditions you have.\\nCOBRA: Another option for temporary health insurance is COBRA from the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act. This option allows you to remain on your employer-based plan from your old job for a period. Since you no longer have an employer who is paying some of your premium, you will be paying more for your insurance.\\nIndustry-specific insurance: Depending on your industry, you may be able to find discounted health insurance through a freelancers union. Industry-specific plans are available for multiple types of professionals. If you find a plan for you, read the fine print to avoid paying more for less coverage than you would get from another plan.\\nOn the other hand, you may decide you want to be self-employed long term. In this case, you may look at alternative coverage options. The right health plan for you depends on who needs coverage and how much money you are making, but you may consider:\\n\\nPrivate health insurance: Some insurance carriers offer plans aimed at self-employed people who need good health care coverage at an affordable premium. For a plan that provides a range of benefits, such as access to in-network hospitals and providers for preventative care and annual checkups, speak with an insurance agent. They can help you find the best health plan at the most affordable rate.\\nHealth insurance marketplace: The health insurance marketplace can help you determine whether you qualify for a lower health insurance premium, tax credits or Medicaid. If you are a low-income earner, you may qualify for Medicaid, which is health insurance sponsored by the government. You may also be eligible for the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which is for children and similar to Medicaid.\\nPartner’s health insurance: If you are married or have a domestic partner, you may want to consider joining their employer-based health insurance plan. If you think you may be eligible for your partner’s employer-based plan, your partner can speak with their insurance company or human resources department to ask about adding you to their plan. This option can be affordable and convenient, as an employer typically helps cover the cost of the plan.\\nHealth care sharing ministry: You may also be able to cover your health care costs through a health care sharing ministry. Note that health care sharing ministries are technically not health insurance. Rather, these are groups of people who are part of an organization like a ministry. You all pool your money into a fund to cover the major health care costs for the group’s members. There may be limits on what a ministry may be willing to pay for, and they may not cover pre-existing conditions.\\nYour specific circumstances may also influence what health insurance options are available to you, like if:\\n\\nYou are a young adult: If you are a young adult, you may be able to stay on your parent’s health insurance until you turn 26.\\nYou are a student: If you are also a student, you may be able to get a plan specifically for students.\\nYou have a disability: If you have a disability, you may qualify for Medicare.\\nYou are in the military: If you are a retired or active military member, you may be eligible for TRICARE.\\nWeigh the pros and cons of each of the options available to you when deciding what self-employed health insurance plan is right for your situation.\\n\\nTax Considerations\\nIf you are self-employed or a small business owner, the prospect of paying your health insurance premiums may seem daunting. Fortunately, you may qualify for a tax write-off for health insurance in California.\\n\\nSelf-Employed Health Insurance as a Deductible Business Expense\\nWhen you file your yearly tax return, you may be able to deduct your health insurance premium, which is the amount you pay every month for the health insurance plan. As a result, you can subtract your total yearly expense from your adjusted gross income. This expense can either increase your refund or decrease your bill.\\n\\nSince this is considered an above-the-line deduction, you can implement it regardless of whether you decide to take the standard deduction or to itemize your deductions. The caveat is that you cannot deduct something higher than your yearly net profit. This restriction means if your small business lost money, you wouldn’t benefit from the tax deduction.\\n\\nAmount of Premium Tax Credit\\nYour premium tax credit amount depends on the estimated income you include on your application. You can opt to apply part or all of your tax credit to your monthly premium. Your tax credit will be sent directly to your health insurance provider so you will pay less every month. This option is known as taking an advance payment on your premium tax credit.\\n\\nIf your income changes, it is likely that your premium tax credit will also change. When you experience a change in your income, you should report it as soon as possible, whether:\\n\\nYour income decreases: If your income decreases, you may be eligible for a larger premium tax credit. In this case, you may want to consider increasing the amount you take in advance on your tax credit. This choice will give you a lower premium bill every month.\\nYour income increases: If your income increases, you may be given a lower premium tax credit. As a result, you may want to choose to reduce how much of your tax credit you take in advance every month so you do not end up taking more tax credits than you actually qualify for.\\nAt the end of the year, if you have taken more advance payments than you are eligible for on your premium tax credit, you may need to pay back the money after you file your income tax return. This payment is referred to as reconciling the premium tax credit you are eligible for and the advance payments if your premium tax credit is based on your final yearly income.\\n\\nRequest a Free Quote for Self-Employed Health Insurance\\nAre you a self-employed California resident?

If so, you may be wondering about health insurance for seniors and the options available to you. There are a number of ways you can supplement Original Medicare.\\n\\nMedicare Advantage Plans\\nMedicare Advantage Plans, also known as “MA Plans” or “Part C,” are offered by private, Medicare-approved companies. These plans include:\\n\\nPreferred Provider Organizations (PPO)\\nSpecial Needs Plans (SNP)\\nPrivate Fee-for-Service Plans (PFFS)\\nMedicare Medical Savings Account Plans (MSA)\\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMO)\\nBy enrolling in a Medicare Advantage Plan, you ensure the Medicare services you receive are covered by your plan rather than by Original Medicare. Many of these plans offer coverage for prescription drugs. This type of plan is county-specific, so you have many different options depending on where you are located in California.\\n\\nPrescription Drug Plans (Part D)\\nA Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Part D is a drug plan that provides coverage for prescription drugs to Original Medicare, assisting with prescription drugs, vaccines, biological products and some supplies not covered by Medicare Part A and Part B. Don’t take any prescriptions? You may still want to consider purchasing a Prescription Drug Plan for future prescription needs and to avoid a penalty from the government.\\n\\nHow to Choose Your Senior Health Insurance Plan\\nYou have several aspects to consider when making crucial decisions about Medicare Advantage and Medicare supplemental plans. The most common considerations for new Medicare recipients include:\\n\\nHow much coverage you need: Consider how much medical coverage you think you’ll need throughout your time on Medicare and plan accordingly. Don’t get the most extensive plan if you feel it would not serve you. However, make sure you have enough coverage for unexpected situations, like an accident or if you develop a new condition.\\nPremiums and out-of-pocket costs: When you retire, your budget will be more important than ever. When exploring your options, you should also make sure that your desired plans fit into what you can afford to spend.\\nAccess to your preferred providers: Medicare plans do not cover all providers. If you have a physician or hospital from which you want to receive treatment, ensure they’re a part of the network you’re exploring.\\nSpeaking with trusted advisors: Whether it’s your best friend, a family member or a plan representative, you may want to discuss your options with someone that fully understands your Medicare options and can give you advice from experience.\\n\\nEligibility and Requirements\\nGenerally, you’re eligible for Medicare when:\\n\\nYou’re 65 years old or older.\\nYou are not 65 but have a qualifying disability or End-Stage Renal disease.\\nYou or your spouse have worked for ten years for an employer covered by Medicare.\\nYou’re a citizen or permanent United States resident.\\nEnrollment\\nYou can begin the enrollment process for Medicare three months before your 65th birthday. You should make sure your enrollment is complete three months after your birthday at the latest. This time is your Initial Enrollment Period. You can enroll by visiting the Social Security website or your local Social security office, or you can call them at 800-772-1213. When you enroll during this period, you can ensure you start getting your benefits as soon as you’re eligible for them and avoid paying penalty fees.\\n\\nIf you miss applying during your Initial Enrollment Period, your next option is to sign up during the General Enrollment Period that happens every year between January 1 and March 31. You may also be eligible for a Special Enrollment Period under certain circumstances.\\n\\nIf you already receive Railroad Retirement or Social Security benefits and you’re turning 65, you might be automatically enrolled in the program.

HMOs are managed care plans that are also often the most affordable health insurance plans you can find. HMOs usually have their own network of doctors, specialists, clinics and hospitals, which allows them to negotiate a certain level of payments for the services their network provides.\\n\\nWhat to Know About HMO Plans\\nHMO plans are a fantastic option for many California residents, but there are many factors to consider when determining if an HMO is right for you. Two primary factors that distinguish an HMO plan include:\\n\\nCost: Providers in an HMO network operate from agreed-upon rates, so they often provide lower monthly premiums than other insurance plans.\\nChoice: When you join an HMO, you need to choose a primary care provider (PCP) from the HMO’s network. This PCP would essentially be your first contact for all non-emergency care.\\nHMOs are a great choice for those that don’t have specialized health care needs. If you find that you only really need annual health exams and immunizations, an HMO plan could help keep your monthly premiums low.\\n\\nHMO vs. PPO\\nHMO plans are just one form of health coverage. Another type of coverage, a preferred provider organization (PPO), is a more flexible type of health insurance that makes it easier to see the provider you want. If you have a longstanding relationship with your PCP and don’t want to forgo using them despite them being out-of-network, you can still see them and maintain some coverage if you have a PPO.\\n\\nHowever, PPOs are more expensive than HMO plans. Because the main benefits of an HMO are lower monthly premiums and out-of-pocket costs, this plan is often a better choice over PPO plans.\\n\\nChoosing a Primary Care Doctor\\nWhen you sign up for an HMO, you need to choose your own PCP from the available providers in the HMO network. While this may sound like a limiting choice, HMO networks usually include thousands of specialists and health care professionals, so finding the right PCP shouldn’t be a problem.\\n\\nExamples of physicians that can be your PCP include:\\n\\nFamily doctors\\nOB/GYNs\\nPediatricians\\nIntern doctors\\nSticking to your covered HMO PCP will help keep your costs low. If you see a provider outside your network, your plan won’t cover your expenses.\\n\\nBenefits of HMO Health Insurance Plans\\nIf you’re switching to an HMO plan, you will enjoy the following benefits:\\n\\nAffordability: HMO insurance plans are affordable, with lower monthly premiums, out-of-pocket expenses and prescription costs.\\nFewer claims: Since your PCP and other specialist care will usually be in-network, you can file fewer claims.\\nConvenience: Having a PCP can be more convenient because you can establish a relationship with them. They will be the ones to coordinate and manage your care, freeing you from the stressful process of finding the specialists and facilities you need.\\nEmergency coverage: Even though you have to use your PCP to be covered for most medical expenses, an HMO will still cover out-of-network care in the event of an emergency.\\n\\nComparing Your HMO Options\\nWant to compare HMO plans for California health insurance side by side? You can get free instant health insurance quotes with Health for California’s online services. You’ll be able to see how California HMO plans compete against each other and find an affordable plan that suits you and your family’s needs.

Under this plan, popular services like office visits, generic drugs, x-rays and labs are covered at a flat fee (copay). A small drug deductible of $250 for an individual or $500 for family will apply for brand name, non-preferred brand name and specialty drugs.  A mid-size deductible of $2,500 per individual applies or $5,000 for a family but only on less commonly-needed services, like hospitalization. To know your price for the Silver 70 Plan and other metal plans, click Affordable Health Insurance for California.\\n\\nIs the Silver 70 Right for Me?\\nThis plan may be a good fit if:\\n\\nYou are relatively healthy.\\nIf you want typical services such as office visits, basic labs, and prescriptions (generic) covered right away for a minimum set fee (copay) without having to pay a deductible.\\nYou want more coverage than the Bronze 60 plan, but want a lower premium per month than the Gold Plan.\\n\\nBronze Plan vs Silver 70 Plan\\nThe Bronze Plan has the lowest premium of all the metal plans with the exception of the Minimum Coverage Plan. The price is right. But with a $6,300 deductible for most services, it might not be the best plan if you often go in for doctor visits. In the long run, it may be more cost-effective to sign up for a Silver 70 Plan. This plan is still competitively-priced and the deductible does not apply to doctor visits, generic prescriptions, x-rays, and labs. So in the long run, you could save money on a Silver 70 Plan. To verify, do the math. Compare the premiums and the out-of-pocket costs for the Bronze and Silver 70 plans to determine which best-fits your budget and health care needs.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nThe Silver 70 Plan has a mid-sized deductible of $2,500 per individual or $5,000 for a family. This applies to benefits such as hospitalization, and ambulance services. This means that if you go in for a service that is subject to the deductible, you pay the first $2,500/$5,000, then, the insurance kicks in. In addition to the deductible, you may also need to pay a fee called a copayment or coinsurance, depending on how much the bill was and what service was received. Altogether, you would never pay more than $6,800 per individual or $13,600 per family per year on a Silver 70 Plan.\\n\\nPrice: $$ and less\\n\\nPopularity: starstarstarstarstar\\n\\nDeductible: $5,400 Individual\\n$10,800 Family\\n\\nDoctor Visits: $50 – $90\\n\\nGeneric Drugs: $19\\n\\nHospital: 20% after deductible up to OOP Max\\n\\nOOP Max: $9,100 Individual\\n$18,200 Family\\n\\nEstimated Avg Medical Costs\\n\\nInsurance Company pays: 70%\\n\\nYou Pay: 30%',\n '2023 Silver 73: Enhanced Plan\\nThe Silver 73 is one of  four Silver health plans available through Covered California. It is available to those who meet the Covered California eligibility requirements and whose income is a certain percentage of the Federal Poverty Level. Obtain a quote for Affordable Health Insurance for California to see if you are eligible for a Silver 73 plan.\\n\\nThe “73” refers to the average percentage that the plan will generally pay for health services. So under the Silver 73, enrollees may anticipate their health plan to pay about 73% of the total covered expenses. This plan features a deductible of $3,700 per individual or $7,400 for a family that is lower than the standard Silver 70 Plan. Also, it allows members to pay reduced fees of $35 to $85 for common services such as doctor visits, generic drugs, and other covered services.  And in the event of “worst case” the most you would pay for services in a year would be $6,500 per individual or $13,000 for a family.\\n\\nIs the Silver 73 Right for Me?\\nThis plan may be a good fit if:\\n\\nYou are relatively healthy.\\nIf you want typical services such as office visits, basic labs, and prescriptions (generic) covered right away for a minimum set fee (copay) without having to pay a deductible.\\nYou want more coverage than the Bronze 60 plan, but want a lower premium per month than the Gold Plan.\\n\\nHow does the Silver 73 compare to the Silver 70 Plan?\\nThe main difference between the Standard Silver 70 and the Enhanced Silver 73 Plans is the deductible size and maximum out-of-pocket amounts that the consumer would pay.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nAn individual may qualify for a Silver 73 Plan only if their income meets the qualifications and if they enroll through the Covered California Exchange. Typically, adults with an annual income of 200% to 250% of the Federal Poverty Level may be eligible for a Covered California Silver 73 Plan. Minors 18 and under do not qualify and more than likely will have the option to enroll on Medi-Cal or some people opt to enroll them on a full priced plan.\\n\\nPrice: $$ and less\\n\\nPopularity: *****\\n\\nDeductible: None\\n\\nDoctor Visits: $35 – $85\\n\\nGeneric Drugs: $15\\n\\nHospital: 20% after deductible\\n\\nOOP Max: $6,100/$12,200 (ind/family)',\n '2023 Silver 87: Enhanced Plan\\nThe Silver 87 Plan is a health plan that gives qualified members more coverage at lower prices. Someone on a Silver 87 Plan will pay less for medical services than someone who is enrolled on a top-of-the-line Platinum Plan. It gives individuals and families a chance to have affordable health insurance without sacrificing good benefits. To see if you qualify, click Affordable Health Insurance for California to receive a free quote.\\n\\nTypical services such as doctor visits, generic  prescriptions, labs, and x-rays are available immediately at a flat rate, commonly called a copay. High-cost services, such as hospitalization, etc. are subject to a $1,400 deductible per individual or $2,800 for a family. The annual drug deductible is $100 per individual or $200 for a family. The plan has a calendar year maximum of $2,700 for an individual or $5,400 for a family, so the member never pays more than this amount in a year.\\n\\nIs the Silver 87 Right For Me?\\nMore often than not, if you qualify for the Silver 87, it will provide you the best coverage for the price.\\nSince the service fees and deductible are low, people with serious or chronic health conditions may wish to consider enrolling on a Silver 87 Plan, if they are eligible.\\n\\nTo qualify for an Enhanced Silver 87 Plan, the application must be submitted through Covered California and the individual must meet Covered California income limits. To understand better, review the Federal Poverty Level Chart. Children 18 and under are not eligible for an enhanced Silver 87 Plan and may qualify for Medi-Cal or can enroll on a plan at the full price.\\n\\nA Little More to Think About\\nYour income is a big factor in qualifying for the Silver 87 Plan. If you qualify, take advantage of the great benefits, but realize if your income increases you may have to select a new plan with different benefits that don’t compare. So if you are putting off a surgery or procedure that you need, do it now while you qualify.\\n\\nNote that the coverage benefits may be different when a doctor or provider is not part of the insurance carrier’s network.

This plan is hands down the best, but comes with a catch. You have to qualify for it.\\n\\nOf all the Covered California metal plans, the Silver 94 offers the lowest out-of-pocket costs for medical services. For example, office visits are a flat fee of $5 or $8 for a specialist. Generic drugs are $3. Most x-rays are $8, lab tests are $8. The most you would pay in a year if the worst happened with the Silver 94 plan is $1,000 for an individual or $2,000 for a family, compared to $4,500/$9000 under the Platinum “top-of-the-line” Plan.

To qualify, you must sign up through Covered California. Also, you must meet Covered California income requirements. Eligibility is determined using your family income, household size, age, and where you live. Generally, you may qualify if your income is just above 138% to 150% of the Federal Poverty Level. Children up to age 18 do not qualify for the enhanced Silver 94 Plan but may qualify for Medi-Cal or can enroll on a full priced plan.\\n\\nIs the Silver 94 Right for Me?\\nIf you qualify for the Silver 94, look no further, this is going to be the best for your money.\\nA Little More to Think About\\nKeep in mind that the Silver 94 Plan is based on your income. So, if you anticipate earning more in the near future, chances are, you may no longer qualify for the Silver 94 Plan when your income goes up. Be prepared, and know what some of the other metal plans are like so you can plan. But take advantage of the great benefits the Silver 94 offers you while you do qualify.\\n\\nIf you are considering a PPO plan, and you have a favorite doctor who is not part of your insurance company’s network, be aware that your cost for the doctor’s services may be a lot higher than if the doctor were in-network. This is true even on the Silver 94 “lowest-cost” Plan. For example, if you were admitted to the hospital and your physician was out-of-network, you may need to pay a deductible, plus an additional 50%, if applicable. Again, this is only if the doctor was out-of-network. In contrast, if your doctor were in-network, your cost under the Silver 94 Plan would be 10% of the bill up to a $2,350 maximum.

Obamacare Has Changed the Way Insurance Providers Calculate Rates for Group Medical Insurance\\nBefore 2014, all small group medical insurance plan rates were based on the age of an employee. For instance, if an employee fell within the age range of 20-29, 30-39, etc., then there was a single rate for that age range.\\n\\nAdditionally, it didn’t matter how many children the employee had or if their spouse was young or old. There was one rate for the whole family, and everything was based on the age of the employee. This is no longer the case. Now, the rate for small group medical insurance is based on the exact age of the employee as well as the age of the spouse and children.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the ACA also eliminated the consideration of pre-existing medical conditions as a basis for determining health rates. In California, this means that the “Risk Adjustment Factor,” which allowed rates to vary by your pre-existing medical conditions, was eliminated. Now, it doesn’t matter if your employees are in good health or not. You get the same rates.\\n\\n2. Obamacare Uses Standard Benefits and Metallic Tiers to Compare Health Plan Benefits\\nMedical insurance is not only complicated, but it’s also expensive. To help people understand the plans and compare one plan with another, Covered California uses a standardized model to determine the rates an insurance plan pays for physician visits, hospitalizations and other benefits.\\n\\nThe result is an AV (Actuarial Value) which sorts the plan into four different categories: Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum. A Platinum plan is the most beneficial plan, which means the insurance plan pays most of the costs while the patient pays the least. In a Platinum plan, the insurance provider pays 90% while you pay 10%. In a Bronze Plan, the insurance pays 60% while you pay 40%. The ACA does not allow plans that cover less than 60% of the health costs.\\n\\n3. Insurance Providers Use Physicians and Hospital Networks to Reduce Costs of Plans\\nHealth care costs vary dramatically between physicians and hospitals. Some are inexpensive, and others are expensive. Health insurance plans that include low-cost providers charge less than those that include high-cost ones.\\n\\nBy enrolling in a health plan that excludes expensive doctors and hospitals, employees can get comprehensive benefits at a modest cost.\\n\\n4. Small Employers Can Offer a Range of Health Insurance Plans to Meet Employees’ Needs\\nEmployees have different needs when it comes to health insurance. Some employees never visit the doctor and only need catastrophic coverage. Others have serious illnesses like diabetes and need a health plan that can cover most of their needs with little contribution from them. The good news is that an employer can tailor insurance plan benefits to meet the needs of the company as well as those of the employees.\\n\\nSome employers can offer a single plan to every employee. Others can offer single HMO or PPO plans. Still, others can offer four to six different plans and allow the employees to choose the one that fits their needs. We understand that offering five to six plans can get quite overwhelming for employees, but insurance providers allow small employers to offer 15 or more plans while minimizing the cost to the employer.\\n\\nSmall Business Enrollment Applications for Employers and Employees\\nUse the links below to enroll in small business health insurance through Covered California including dental:\\n\\nCovered CA Small Business - https://hp-prod-wp-data.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/uploads/2023+Employer+App+Fillable.pdf – Employer Application – Enroll your business.\\nEmployee Application - https://hp-prod-wp-data.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/content/uploads/2024+Employee+App+and+Change+Form.pdf – Enroll specific employees on the health plan.\\n\\nCovered California for Small Business\\nYou’re eligible for Covered California for your small business if:\\n\\nYou have at least one W-2 employee, in addition to owners, officers or spouse thereof.\\nFederal Employer Identification Number (FEIN).\\nPayroll Records\\n\\nGet Group Health Insurance Quotes in California\\nRunning a small business is difficult enough without all the confusion that group health insurance can bring.

Not everyone needs health insurance during open enrollment. So what happens when you lose a job and the health benefits that come with it? Moved? Got married or had a baby? The healthcare special enrollment period is for times like these.\\n\\nOutside open enrollment you can sign up for health insurance with a qualified life event. This is like a valid ticket that allows you or a qualified family member to enroll for an individual or family health plan.\\n\\nQualified Life Events\\nA qualified life event is a circumstance that has occurred within the last 60 days. The 60 days are counted from the date the application is submitted. Some of the most common life events are\\n\\nInvoluntary loss of health insurance\\nPermanently moved to/within California\\nHad a baby\\nGot married\\nExceptions\\nA life event is not required for those that are federally recognized American-Indians, Native Alaskans, and those who qualify for Medi-Cal. They can enroll year around.\\n\\nSpecial Enrollment Dates\\n\\n\\nYear\\tOpen Enrollment Dates\\tSpecial Enrollment Dates\\n2022\\tNovember 1 – January 31\\tFebruary 1 – October 31\\n2023 and beyond\\tNovember 1 – January 31\\tFebruary 1 – October 31\\nThe dates for the open enrollment periods were announced by CMS (Centers of Medicare & Medicaid) for the Federal Government’s Health Insurance Exchange. The rest of the year is typically considered the special enrollment period. Covered California has yet to formally announce the dates for California, but historically they have always followed the Federal Government’s lead.\\n\\nEffective Dates and Deadlines\\nWhether it’s SEP enrollment or not, most people do n0t want a gap in coverage. Your qualified life event and the date you submit your application determines the effective date.\\n\\nIt is extremely important to know when you need your insurance to start, so you know the deadline to apply by. Usually, you must enroll by the 15th of the month to receive an effective date of the 1st of the next month.\\n\\nHowever, if you are losing your coverage, often you can apply by the end of the month and still start your coverage on the 1st of the next month. Although, we recommend not waiting until the last couple days of the month.\\n\\nComparison\\nWhat is the difference between the Obamacare special enrollment period and open enrollment?\\n\\nOpen Enrollment\\tSpecial Open Enrollment\\nWho can apply?\\tMost everyone ( i.e. All U.S. citizens, U.S.\\nnationals or lawfully present immigrants)\\tOnly those with a qualified life event\\nWhen can you apply?\\tDuring the open enrollment window of time\\tWithin 60 days of the qualifying life event date',\n 'Supplemental Health Insurance Plans\\nSupplemental health insurance plans are health care plans used to cover anything above and beyond basic medical coverage. These plans provide extra medical coverage and can also be used to contribute to other costs not covered by your primary insurance plan such as copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles.\\n\\nDental\\nTravel Insurance\\nVision\\nMedicare Supplemental Plus\\n\\nMost people with insurance from their employers may not be familiar with supplemental health insurance plans because they’ve never thought they needed them. That is until they receive medical bills from their primary doctor’s offices only to see a recent service that was not covered by their original plan.\\n\\nOr maybe they bought individual insurance plans and had to sacrifice coverage in certain areas to gain more protection in other areas. And again, there are so many things that are not adequately covered by most health insurance plans.\\n\\nWell, the good news is that supplemental health insurance helps you handle any medical costs and out-of-pocket expenses that come your way.\\n\\nHow Do Supplemental Health Insurance Plans Work?\\nSupplemental health insurance plans pay benefits to you. The amount you receive and how frequent it is paid out depends on the insurance coverage you have. Some common supplemental health plans provide specific disease coverage such as for cancer, Medigap, dismemberment insurance, accidental death, and hospital indemnity insurance.\\n\\nWho Needs Supplemental Health Insurance?\\nNot everyone needs supplemental health coverage. While most of these plans are cheap, you certainly don’t need twofold coverage. Check out your basic health insurance policy to see if there any gaps in coverage. You don’t need supplemental health insurance unless you will potentially suffer the risk of financial strain from medical services not covered by your basic plan. On the other hand, if you have a risky job or a family history of serious illness that could cost you a lot, supplemental insurance can give you peace of mind for future uncertainties.\\n\\nHere Are Some Examples of Supplemental Health Insurance Plans\\nThere are many different types of supplemental health plans in California, most of which are specific to a particular area of coverage. Often, these plans are purchased on their own, which means you don’t need to be on any other medical plan to buy them.\\n\\nMedicare Supplemental Plans: For seniors ages 65+ and qualified disabled individuals, after getting Medicare Parts A and B, they can add to their coverage by purchasing Medicare Advantage or a senior supplemental plan. Medicare Advantage tends to be more affordable, and the supplemental plans tend to offer more benefits and bigger doctor networks. Medicare Advantage usually includes prescription drugs, but supplemental plans do not. If you end up going with supplemental Medicare benefits, you’ll also want to add Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Coverage.\\nDental Health Insurance: Basic health insurance plans cover dental benefits up to 18 years of age. If you are over 18 years of age, you would need to buy stand-alone dental health insurance coverage from an insurance company.\\nShort Term Health Insurance: This is a viable insurance plan for people who need coverage for less than six months. For instance, it would be perfect for individuals who are in-between insurance plans or for those who cannot afford regular insurance but would like to have short-term coverage.\\nTravel Health Insurance: This is a great plan for anyone traveling out of the United States to another country. It covers illnesses or accidents that happen while you were traveling. The plan period is valid from when you leave your country until you arrive at your destination.\\nFinding the Right Supplemental Health Insurance Plan\\nIt can be difficult to find the right supplemental health coverage even when you know what your budget and needs are. Common sense will go a long way in helping you find the best policy. Our online services will provide you with free, instant quotes for supplemental health insurance plans from the top insurance companies in California.\\n\\nJust take a few seconds to complete our confidential form.

It does not cover medical services such as doctor visits, prescriptions, preventive services, or pre-existing conditions. For more information, click Short Term Health Insurance.\\n\\nInternational Travel Health Insurance\\nMost anyone who is temporarily leaving their home country can benefit. International travel health insurance provides medical protection for American citizens leaving their country as well as for non-Americans while they are traveling in the U.S. Many types of travelers can apply and get international travel health insurance: newlyweds on honeymoon, people on missionary trips, business travelers and many more.\\n\\nNote that international travel health insurance enrollment is not subject to medical underwriting, so you can’t be denied for pre-existing conditions; however, be aware that pre-existing conditions are not covered.\\n\\nHow does international medical insurance work?\\nGenerally speaking, a travel medical insurance policy helps you with expenses for sudden and unexpected injury and illness while you are traveling outside of your home country. Emergency travel benefits also include some non-medical expenses, such as lost luggage, lodging replacement due to a natural disaster, or assistance with a return trip home due to a covered incident. If a covered incident was to come up, you would pay out of pocket until you reach the deductible amount, if applicable. After the deductible is satisfied, then, the insurance company will pay 80% of the next $5,000 of covered expenses. After that point, the international travel medical insurance carrier will pay 100% of covered expenses up to the overall maximum limit. The maximum coverage period for international travel insurance is 365 days for non-US citizens or residents traveling outside of the U.S. or U.S. Territories. For all other members, the maximum coverage period is 364 days. The minimum age to enroll is 14 days old. We offer international travel health insurance through HCC Travel Medical Insurance Services, which syndicates with Lloyd’s of London to offer international coverage. Their plan offerings allow you to customize the policy. You select the deductible size, coverage limit, and the policy period you want.\\n\\nWhat does international travel health insurance cover?\\nBelow are some common benefits on international travelers insurance. Note that restrictions apply and that this list is not all-inclusive.\\n\\nHospital charges for inpatient and outpatient services.\\nUrgent care in U.S. or Canada, providing it is not preventive or for a pre-existing condition.\\nPrescriptions related to a covered injury or illness. The cost to replace existing prescriptions due to loss, stolen, damaged, or expired medicines is not covered.\\nInternational Travel Medical Insurance covers health services rendered due to pregnancy complications.\\nMedical costs for an emergency medical evacuation.\\nTravel health insurance covers the return trip home if your trip is interrupted due to:\\nThe death of an immediate family member.\\nYour home being severely destroyed.\\nA medical necessity.\\nEmergency dental services due to a covered accident.\\nMedical expenses for illness or injury resulting from terrorism.\\nReplacement accommodations if you are evacuated due to a natural disaster.\\nLost checked luggage.\\n\\nWhat is not covered under international travel health insurance?\\nAgain, this is not the whole list, but these are some of the main exclusions.\\n\\nMedical services for pre-existing health conditions.\\nTraditional emergency room visits, unless you are admitted to the hospital.\\nRoutine or preventative services.\\nPre-natal care services.\\nCosts that are over the usual, reasonable, and customary charges.\\nTravel insurance benefits do not apply while an American citizen is traveling in a U.S. state or territory.\\n\\nCan I cancel my travel health insurance?\\nTravel insurance can be cancelled. There is no cost if you cancel your travel insurance before the travel dates. If you request cancellation during the policy period, the premium will be pro-rated and a $25 cancellation fee added.\\n\\nNote: If there is any discrepancy between the above information and the HCC policy provisions, the HCC policy provisions will prevail.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor more information on temporary coverage, click Short Term Health Insurance.',\n 'Valley Health Insurance Coverage\\nFind the Lowest Prices Available on Valley Medical Insurance Plans or Get Discounts Through Our Covered California Options\\nValley Health Plan\\n\\nSanta Clara County has been served by Valley Health Plan (VHP) for over 30 years of serving Santa Clara county.
